                    <h1>Binomial Numenclature</h1>
                    <h2>Historical Background</h2>

<p>The study of botany has its roots in the investigation of medicinal plants during prehistoric times. However, the systematic study of plants began during the Renaissance and Reformation periods in the 16th century.</p><br>
Key contributors to botanical classification include:

<p><b>Tuner (1515-1568):</b> An English physician and botanist, considered the father of English botany.<br>
<b>Caesalpinus (1519-1603):</b> An Italian botanist.<br>
<b>Kaspar Bauhin (1560-1624):</b> Known for his contributions to plant classification.<br>
<b>Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778):</b> A Swedish naturalist and professor who developed the binomial system of nomenclature and used reproductive structures for plant classification.</p>
Linnaeus’s work was further developed by:

<p><b>De Candolle (1819):</b> Advanced botanical classification.<br>
<b>Bentham (1800-1884) and Hooker (1817-1911):</b> Contributed to the systematic classification of plants.<br>
<b>Engler and Prantl (1887-1901):</b> Provided a comprehensive account of flowering plant families and cryptogams.<br>
<b>Hutchinson (early 20th century):</b> Developed a natural classification system for monocotyledons and dicotyledons.</p>
<b>General Principles of Classification</b><br><br>
Methodology of Classification
<p>Plants exhibit great diversity in form, physiology, and habitat, ranging from unicellular forms to complex flowering plants. Evidence from paleontology suggests that complex plants evolved from simpler forms through gradual evolutionary processes. An evolutionary tree can be constructed to illustrate this progression, with simpler organisms at the base and more complex ones at the top.</p>

<b>Criteria for Classification</b><br>
Plants are classified based on:<br>

<p>-Morphological Features: Physical characteristics.<br>
-Physiological Features: Functional characteristics.<br>
-Evolutionary (Phylogenetic) Relationships: Genetic and evolutionary connections.<br>
The sum of these common features is called the characteristic feature of a group.</p>

Natural and Artificial Classification
<p><b>Natural Classification:</b> Considers all important characteristics.<br>
<b>Artificial Classification:</b> Selects a few characteristics arbitrarily for grouping.</p>

<b>Units of Classification</b><br>
The smallest unit of classification is the 
<p><b>Species:</b> group of individuals with similar structures, functions, and the ability to interbreed to produce fertile offspring.<br>
<b>Genus:</b> Collection of related species.<br>
<b>Family:</b> Collection of related genera.<br>
<b>Order:</b> Collection of related families.<br>
<b>Class:</b> Collection of related orders.<br>
<b>Division:</b> Collection of related classes.<br>
<b>Kingdom:</b> Collection of related divisions.</p>
<p>The Binomial System of Nomenclature
Devised by Carl Linnaeus, this system gives every organism two names:<br>

-Genus Name: Begins with a capital letter.<br>
-Species Name: Begins with a lowercase letter.<br>
Both names are underlined separately in manuscripts or italicized in print, and they are typically Latin or Latinized names.</p>

Example:

<p><i>Dioscorea rotundata</i> (White Yam) <br>
<i>Dioscorea cayenensis</i> (Yellow Yam)<br>
<i>Dioscorea alata</i> (Water Yam)<br>
<i>Dioscorea dumetorum</i> (Three-leaved Yam)<br>
<i>Dioscorea bulbifera</i> (Aerial Yam)<br>
<i>Dioscorea esculenta</i> (Chinese Yam)</p>
<b>The Five-Kingdom System;</b>

<p>The traditional two-kingdom system posed classification challenges, leading to the development of a five-kingdom system by Whittaker:

<b>Animalia:</b> Multicellular, motile organisms (heterotrophs).<br>
<b>Plantae:</b> Multicellular, non-motile, green organisms (autotrophs).<br>
<b>Protista:</b> Unicellular eukaryotic organisms (algae and protozoa).<br>
<b>Procaryotae/Monera:</b> Prokaryotic organisms (bacteria and blue-greens).<br>
<b>Mycota/Fungi:</b> Non-green, non-motile, absorptive heterotrophs.</p>
<b>Geological Time Scale and Plant Evolution</b>
<p>A geological time scale outlines the appearance of different plant groups through eras:<br>

<b>Cenozoic Era:</b> Dominated by herbaceous plants and angiosperms.<br>
<b>Mesozoic Era:</b> Age of gymnosperms and pteridophytes.<br>
<b>Paleozoic Era:</b> Age of marine algae and early land plants.</p>

<h3>Plant Groups and Their Characteristics</h3><br>

                    <h2>Review of Plant Kingdom</h2>
                    <h1> Thallophyes, Bacterial, Virus </h1>
                    <b>Thallophytes</b>
<b>General Overview</b>
<p>Thallophytes represent some of the simplest forms of plant life, encompassing a wide variety of organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and lichens. They are characterized by their lack of true roots, stems, and leaves. Sexual reproduction is common in algae, fungi, and lichens, while it is absent in prokaryotic thallophytes like bacteria, viruses, and blue-green algae.</p>

<b>Reproduction in Thallophytes</b>
<p>Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes, a process known as fertilization or syngamy.</p> There are different types of gametes based on their morphology and motility:

<p><b>Isogamy:</b> Fusion of identical motile gametes.<br>
<b>Anisogamy:</b> Fusion of dissimilar motile gametes.<br>
<b>Oogamy:</b> Fusion of a motile male gamete (antherozoid) with a non-motile female gamete (egg or ovum).<br>
<b>Conjugation:</b> A variation of isogamy involving the fusion of non-motile gametes through a conjugation tube.<br>
<b>Zooidogamy:</b> Fertilization involving at least one actively swimming (flagellated) gamete.</p>
<h3>Bacteria</h3>
<b>Occurrence</b>
<p>Bacteria are among the most widely distributed organisms on Earth, found in air, water, soil, living organisms, and dead organic matter. They thrive in various conditions, from sub-zero temperatures to boiling hot springs.</p>

<b>General Characteristics</b>
<p><b>Size and Shape:</b> Bacteria are extremely small, usually less than 0.005 mm in diameter. Common shapes include spherical (coccus), rod-like (bacillus), comma-shaped (vibrio), and spiral (spirillum).<br>
<b>Pathogenicity:</b> Some bacteria cause diseases such as tuberculosis, tetanus, diphtheria, and cholera. However, many bacteria are beneficial and essential for various ecological processes.<br>
<b>Cell Structure:</b> Bacteria have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, often surrounded by a slimy capsule. The cell contains protoplasm, a cell membrane, and a long thread of DNA, but lacks a true nucleus. Some bacteria have flagella for movement.<br>
<b>Respiration:</b> Bacteria can be aerobic (requiring oxygen) or anaerobic (capable of respiration without oxygen). Anaerobic respiration often involves fermentation, producing gases and organic compounds.</P>
<b>Mode of Life</b>
<b>Respiration:</b> <p>Aerobic bacteria use free oxygen, while anaerobic bacteria can live without it.</p>
<b>Feeding:</b><br><br>
Heterotrophic Bacteria:
<p><b>Saprophytes:</b> Feed on dead organic matter.<br>
<b>Parasites:</b> Feed on living hosts.</p>
Autotrophic Bacteria:
<p><b>Photosynthetic Bacteria:</b> Use sunlight to produce food.<br>
<b>Chemosynthetic Bacteria:</b> Use chemical reactions to produce food.<p>
<b>Reproduction</b>
<p>Bacteria reproduce asexually through binary fission or spore formation under unfavorable conditions. Spores can resist harsh environments and germinate when conditions improve.</p>

<h3>Viruses</h3>
<b>Structure</b>
<p>Viruses are non-cellular, tiny particles with a protein coat and nucleic acid core (DNA or RNA). They vary in shape, from rod-like (e.g., Tobacco Mosaic Virus) to spherical and tadpole-shaped (e.g., bacteriophages).</p>

<b>Life Cycle</b>
Viruses reproduce by infecting host cells:

<p><b>Lytic Cycle:</b> The virus injects its DNA into the host cell, multiplies, and causes the host cell to burst, releasing new viruses.<br>
<b>Lysogenic Cycle:</b> Viral DNA integrates into the host genome and replicates with it, eventually entering the lytic cycle.<br>

<h3>Algae</h3>
<b>Classification and Evolution</b>
<p>Algae are diverse, ranging from unicellular forms (e.g., Chlamydomonas) to complex multicellular forms (e.g., Ulva, Fucus). They are classified based on their pigments, cell wall materials, and storage products. The principal pigments and cell wall composition suggest that higher plants evolved from green algae.</p>

<b>Notable Algae</b>
<p><b>Oscillatoria:</b> A blue-green alga found in moist environments, reproducing vegetatively by fragmentation.<br>
<b>Chlamydomonas:</b> A unicellular green alga with both asexual and sexual reproduction involving flagellated gametes.<br>
<b>Spirogyra:</b> A filamentous green alga that reproduces vegetatively by fragmentation and sexually by conjugation.</p>
<b>Importance</b>
<p>Algae play significant roles in oxygen production and serving as food for aquatic organisms. However, excessive growth can lead to water pollution and oxygen depletion, affecting aquatic life.</p>

<b>Specific Examples</b><br><br>
Bacteria
<p><b>Escherichia coli:</b> Commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals.<br>
<b>Vibrio cholerae:</b> Causes cholera, a severe diarrheal disease.</p>
Viruses
<p><b>Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV):</b> Infects plants, causing mottling of leaves.<br>
<b>Bacteriophages:</b> Infect bacteria, often used in research and biotechnology.</p>
Algae
<p><b>Chlamydomonas:</b> Exhibits both asexual and sexual reproduction, found in stagnant water.<br>
<b>Spirogyra:</b> Known for its spiral chloroplasts, reproduces through conjugation.</p>

                    <h2>Review of Plant Kigdom II</h2>
                    <h1>Fungi</h1>
                    
<h2>General Characteristics</h2> 
<p>Lack of Chlorophyll: Fungi do not contain chlorophyll, the green pigment in most plants, making them unable to photosynthesize and thus heterotrophic.</p>
<p>Mycelium Structure: The thallus (body) of fungi, called mycelium, consists of threadlike structures called hyphae in true fungi, and plasmodia in slime molds.</P>
<h3>Feeding Mechanisms:</h3>
<p>Saprophytes: Feed on dead and decaying matter.</P>
<p>Parasites: Feed on living hosts, potentially causing harm. Obligate parasites cannot survive on dead hosts, whereas facultative parasites can continue to live saprophytically on dead hosts.</P>
<p>Digestion: Extracellular, with enzymes diffusing out of the hyphae to digest food externally, which is then absorbed (absorptive heterotrophy).</p>
<p>Cell Wall Composition: Made of chitin and fungal cellulose, not typical plant cellulose.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate Storage: Store carbohydrates as glycogen, not starch.</p>
<p>Mycelium Cells: Can be pseudoparenchymatous (with walls, called hyphae) or without walls (plasmodium).</p>

<h2>Classification of Fungi</h2>
<h3>Class I: Myxomycetes (Slime Molds)</h3>
<p>Found on rotting logs, old stumps, and decaying humus.
Spores germinate into flagellated cells that later transform into myxoamoebae.
Feeding stage: Plasmodium, a mass of protoplasm with multiple nuclei but no cell walls.
Produces sporangia containing spores.
Considered part of the kingdom Protista by some botanists.</p>

<h3>Class II: Phycomycetes (Alga-like Fungi)</h3>
<p>Terrestrial species reproduce by conjugation; aquatic species by oogamy.
Includes downy mildews and black bread molds (e.g., Mucor, Pythium, Rhizopus).</p>

<h3>Class III: Ascomycetes (Sac Fungi)<h3>
<p>Produce sexual spores called ascospores inside sacs (asci).
Include yeasts (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae), blue-green molds (e.g., Aspergillus, Penicillium), and powdery mildews.</p>
<h3>Class IV: Basidiomycetes (Club Fungi)</h3>
<p>Produce sexual spores called basidiospores on club-shaped structures (basidia).
Include mushrooms, rusts, smuts, and puffballs.</p>
<h3>Class V: Deuteromycetes (Imperfect Fungi)</h3>
<p>Do not produce sexual spores, reproducing only by asexual spores (conidia).
Include fungi responsible for human diseases like ringworm.
Specific Examples
Rhizopus nigricans (Black Bread Mold)

Mycelium consists of stolons, rhizoids, and sporangiophores.
Sexual reproduction involves the formation of zygospores.
Asexual reproduction involves the release of spores from sporangia.
Saccharomyces (Yeast)

Unicellular fungi used in bread making and brewing.
Reproduces asexually by budding and sexually through the formation of ascospores.
Involves processes like fission and budding under different conditions.
Mushrooms (Agaricus campestris)

Basidiomycete fungi with fleshy fruiting bodies.
Structure includes a stalk (stipe) and a cap (pileus) with gills underneath.
Reproduction involves the formation of basidiospores on basidia.

<h2>Economic Importance of Fungi</h2>
<h3>Beneficial Aspects:<h3>
<p>Decay and Decomposition: Essential in recycling nutrients by decomposing dead organisms.</P>
<p>Food and Fermentation: Used in the production of edible mushrooms, bread, wine, beer, and cheese.</p>
<p>Medicine: Source of antibiotics like penicillin and drugs like ergot.</p>
<p>Agriculture: Form beneficial mycorrhizal relationships with plants.</p>
<p>Science: Used as research tools in genetics and microbiology.</p>

<h3>Harmful Aspects:</h3>
<p>Cause skin diseases (e.g., ringworm, athlete's foot) and deeper infections in humans and animals.</p>
<p>Responsible for food spoilage and plant diseases.</p>
<p>Damage to fabrics, leather, woodwork, and stored goods.</p>

<h2>Lichens</h2>
<p>Symbiotic Association: Between a fungus (usually Ascomycetes) and an alga (green or blue-green).</p>
<p>Structure: The thallus is made of fungal hyphae and algal cells, exhibiting different forms (crustose, foliose, fruticose).</p>
<p>Ecological Role: Can inhabit extreme environments, serve as fodder, and produce useful substances like litmus dye and components for cosmetics.</p><br> <br> <br>

                    <h2>Review of Plant Kigdom III</h2>
                    <h1>Spermatophyta</h1>
<p>The division Spermatophyta encompasses seed-bearing vascular plants. These plants reproduce and propagate through seeds, exhibiting what is known as "seed habit." Spermatophytes are believed to have evolved from the genus Selaginella, which shows early seed habit characteristics.</p>

Classification of Spermatophytes<br>
<p>Spermatophytes are divided into two classes:<br>

Class Gymnospermae (Gymnosperms)<br>
Class Angiospermae (Angiosperms)</p>

Characteristics of Gymnospermae
<P><b>Woody Plants:</b> Gymnosperms are usually trees or shrubs.<br>
<b>Roots:</b> They possess tap roots often in symbiosis with algae and fungi.<br>
<b>Reproductive Structures:</b> Male and female cones, called microsporophylls and megasporophylls respectively, house reproductive structures.<br>
<b>Microsporangia:</b> Located on the abaxial surface of microsporophylls.<br>
<b>Megasporangia:</b> Borne naked on megasporophylls.<br>
<b>Pollination:</b> Achieved through direct contact of pollen grains with ovules.<br>
<b>Nourishment of Embryo</b>: Provided by a haploid nutritive tissue formed before fertilization.<br>
<b>Vascular Tissues</b>: Phloem with sieve cells and xylem with tracheids.</p>
Classification of Gymnosperms
<p>Gymnosperms are further divided into five orders:<br>

-Order Cycadales (e.g., Cycas)<br>
-Order Coniferales (e.g., Pinus)<br>
-Order Taxales (e.g., Taxus)<br>
-Order Ginkgoales (e.g., Ginkgo)<br>
-Order Gnetales (e.g., Gnetum)</p>

<h3><b>Order Cycadales</b></h3>
General Characteristics:

<p>-Smaller compared to other gymnosperms.<br>
-Slender, unbranched stems with soft wood.<br>
-Radially symmetrical seeds.<br>
-Palm-like appearance with large pinnate leaves.<br>
-Male cones formed by microsporophylls.<br>
-Female cones formed by megasporophylls, except in Cycas, where they form a loose crown.<br>
-Produce motile, multiflagellated sperms.</p>

Example: <h3><b>Cycas</b></h3>

External Morphology:

<p>-Widely distributed in Africa, Eastern Asia, and Australia.<br>
-Cultivated as ornamental plants (e.g., Cycas revoluta).<br>
-Evergreen, slow-growing, and long-lived.<br>
-Unbranched, erect stem with a crown of pinnately compound leaves, resembling a palm tree or tree fern.<br>
-Adventitious roots with "coralloid" structures due to microbial infection.<br>
-Leaves are either large, green, and assimilatory or smaller, dry, and scaly.</p>
Reproduction:

<p><b>Heterosporous and Dioecious:</b> Separate male and female plants.<br>
<b>Male Cone:</b> Consists of microsporophylls with microsporangia on the abaxial surface, producing microspores.<br>
<b>Female Reproductive Structures:</b> Megasporophylls bearing megasporangia, which develop into ovules.<br>
<b>Pollination:</b> Pollen grains enter the ovule, forming a pollen tube that releases sperms for fertilization.<br>
<b>Fertilization:</b> Involves fusion of male and female nuclei to form a zygote, which develops into an embryo. The ovule matures into a seed.</p>

Characteristics of Angiospermae
<p><b>Enclosed Seeds:</b> Seeds are enclosed in fruits derived from ovaries.<br>
<b>Flowers:</b> Reproductive structures are flowers, not cones.<br>
<b>Sporophylls:</b> Stamens and pistils are extensively modified.<br>
<b>Ovules:</b> Embedded within female sporophylls.<br>
<b>Reduced Gametophytes:</b> Male gametophyte (pollen) has three nuclei; female gametophyte typically has eight nuclei.<br>
<b>Pollination:</b> Pollen is deposited on the stigma, not directly on the ovule.<br>
<b>Double Fertilization:</b> One sperm fertilizes the egg, forming a zygote; another sperm fuses with the fusion nucleus, forming triploid endosperm.<br>
<b>Vascular Tissue:</b> Xylem with vessels and phloem with sieve tubes and companion cells.</p>
Classification of Angiosperms

<p>Two subclasses:<br>
-Monocotyledonae (Monocots)<br>
-Dicotyledonae (Dicots)</P>

<h3><b>Monocotyledonae:</b></h3>

<p>-Embryos have one cotyledon.<br>
-Lack cambium; no secondary growth.<br>
-Scattered vascular bundles.<br>
-Parallel leaf venation.<br>
-Narrow leaves.<br>
-Flower parts in threes.<br>
-Phloem with sieve cells.</p>

<h3><b>Dicotyledonae</b></h3>

<p>-Embryos have two cotyledons.<br>
-Possess cambium; show secondary growth.<br>
-Vascular bundles in a ring.<br>
-Net-like leaf venation.<br>
-Broad leaves with petioles.<br>
-Flower parts in fours or fives.<br>
-Phloem with sieve tubes and companion cells.<br>
-Reproduction in Angiosperms</p>
Vegetative Reproduction:

<p>Via stems, leaves, roots, rhizomes, and bulbils.</P>
Sexual Reproduction:

<p><b>Flowers:</b> Made of accessory (perianth) and essential (sporophylls) parts. <br>
<b>Development of Ovule:</b> Involves formation of megaspores and female gametophyte within the ovule.<br>
<b>Development of Pollen:</b> Microspores develop into pollen grains containing male gametophytes.<br>
<b>Pollination:</b> Pollen grains are transferred to the stigma.<br>
<b>Fertilization:</b> Involves the fusion of male and female gametes, forming a zygote and triploid endosperm.</p>
Fertilization

<p><b>Pollen Tube Growth:</b>
Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma, it germinates, forming a pollen tube that grows down through the style to reach the ovule.<br>
The tube nucleus guides the pollen tube, while the generative cell divides to form two sperm cells.</p>

<p><b>Double Fertilization:</b>
One sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to form a diploid zygote (2n), which will develop into the embryo.
The second sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei in the central cell of the embryo sac to form a triploid endosperm (3n), which will provide nourishment for the developing embryo.</p>
Embryo Development
<p><b>Zygote Division:</b>

The zygote undergoes mitotic divisions, forming a small, multicellular structure known as the embryo.</p>
Formation of Suspensor:

<p>-The initial division of the zygote results in a terminal cell and a basal cell.<br>
-The basal cell divides to form the suspensor, a structure that anchors the embryo and aids in nutrient transfer from the endosperm to the embryo.<br>
-The terminal cell gives rise to the main body of the embryo.</p>
Embryo Differentiation:

<p>The embryo undergoes further division and differentiation, forming distinct regions such as the radicle (future root), plumule (future shoot), and cotyledons (seed leaves).</p>
Endosperm Development
<p><b>Cell Division:</b>
The triploid endosperm nucleus divides repeatedly to form the endosperm tissue, which serves as a food reserve for the developing embryo.<br>
<b>Formation of Nutrient Tissue:</b>
In many seeds, the endosperm remains as a separate tissue, storing nutrients like starch, proteins, and lipids that the embryo will use during germination.<br></p>
Seed Coat Formation
<p><b>Integuments Transformation:</b>
The integuments surrounding the ovule develop into seed coats. The outer integument becomes the testa, and the inner integument becomes the tegmen.<br>
<b>Protection:</b>
These seed coats protect the embryo and endosperm from physical damage and desiccation.</p>
Seed Types
<p><b>Endospermic (Albuminous) Seeds:</b>
Seeds where the endosperm persists as a storage tissue at maturity (e.g., wheat, maize).<br>
<b>Non-Endospermic (Exalbuminous) Seeds:</b>
Seeds where the endosperm is absorbed during development, and the nutrients are stored in the cotyledons (e.g., peas, beans).</p>
Fruit Development
<p>Following fertilization, the ovary undergoes significant changes to develop into a fruit, which aids in seed dispersal. </p>

Transformation of the Ovary
<p><b>Pericarp Formation:</b>

The ovary wall thickens and differentiates into three layers: the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp, and the inner endocarp.<br>
These layers collectively form the pericarp, the wall of the fruit.<br>
<b>Accessory Structures:</b>
In some fruits, other floral parts (like the receptacle, petals, and sepals) contribute to the formation of the fruit, creating what is known as an accessory fruit (e.g., apples, strawberries).</p>

Types of Fruits
<p><b>Simple Fruits:</b>
Develop from a single ovary of a single flower (e.g., cherries, tomatoes).<br>
<b>Aggregate Fruits:</b>
Develop from multiple ovaries of a single flower (e.g., raspberries, blackberries).<br>
<b>Multiple Fruits:</b>
Develop from the ovaries of multiple flowers that fuse together (e.g., pineapples).</p>

Fruit Ripening
<p><b>Physiological Changes:</b>
Fruits undergo various physiological changes during ripening, including color change, softening, and sweetening.<br>
<b>Enzyme Activity:</b>
Enzymes like pectinase and amylase break down cell walls and starches, leading to a softer texture and sweeter taste.</p>

Seed Dispersal Mechanisms
<p><b>By Wind:</b>
Fruits with structures like wings or parachutes (e.g., dandelions, maples) are adapted for wind dispersal.<br>
<b>By Water:</b>
Some fruits can float and are dispersed by water (e.g., coconuts).<br>
<b>By Animals:</b>
Fruits may be eaten by animals, and seeds are later excreted (e.g., berries).
Some fruits have hooks or spines that attach to animal fur (e.g., burdock).</p>

Seed Germination
<p><b>Dormancy:</b>
Many seeds undergo a period of dormancy, during which they remain inactive until conditions are favorable for germination.<br>
<b>Germination Process:</b>
Upon encountering favorable conditions (e.g., water, temperature), the seed absorbs water, swells, and breaks through the seed coat.
The radicle emerges first, anchoring the seedling, followed by the plumule, which grows upward to form the shoot.</p>

<h3><b>Leaf</b></h3>
<p>The leaf is the primary food-making organ of a plant and a lateral outgrowth of stems and branches. Leaves typically consist of two main parts: "a stalk called the petiole" and an "expanded, flattened portion called the blade".<br> The green color of most foliage leaves is due to chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis. <br>Leaves contain stomata, tiny openings that allow for the exchange of gases necessary for photosynthesis and transpiration.</p>

Leaves come in two basic types:

<p><b>Simple Leaf:</b> Has a single, undivided blade, e.g., an oak leaf.<br>
<b>Compound Leaf:</b> Has a blade composed of several leaflets, e.g., a clover leaf. Compound leaves can be pinnately compound (leaflets in two opposite rows) or palmately compound (leaflets radiating from a single point).<br></P>
The arrangement of leaves, known as phyllotaxy, varies:

<p><b>Alternate:</b> Leaves arranged in a spiral around the stem.<br>
<b>Opposite:</b> Pairs of leaves attached at the same level.<br>
<b>Decussate:</b> Successive pairs of leaves at right angles.<br>
<b>Verticillate (Whorled):</b> More than two leaves attached at the same level.</p>
<img src="leaf.png" alt="Leaf" class="leaf"> <br>
<h3><b>Leaf Adaptations</b></h3>


Leaves have various specialized forms:

<p><b>Pine Needles:</b> Highly modified leaves with a waxy coating to prevent water loss.<br>
<b>Dimorphic Leaves:</b> Different shapes on the same stem, as seen in eucalyptus.<br>
<b>Succulents:</b> Thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water.<br>
<b>Evergreen Leaves:</b> Tough, waxy surfaces to withstand environmental conditions.<br>
<b>Carnivorous Leaves:</b> Modified to trap and digest insects, e.g., Venus flytrap.</p>

<h3><b>Stem</h3></b>
<p>The stem is the part of the plant that commonly bears leaves and buds. It can be aerial or subterranean. Stems serve to support leaves and reproductive structures, conduct water and nutrients, and sometimes store food. Stems contain vascular bundles composed of xylem (conducts water) and phloem (transports sugars).</p>

<h3><b>Flower</b></h3>
<p>A flower is the reproductive organ of flowering plants and consists of modified leaves arranged in whorls:

<b>Sepals:</b> Outermost whorl, protecting the bud.<br>
<b>Petals:</b> Attract pollinators with their color and scent.<br>
<b>Stamens:</b> Male reproductive organs producing pollen.<br>
<b>Carpels:</b> Female reproductive organs containing the ovary, style, and stigma.<br>
Flowers can be complete (having all four whorls) or incomplete. They can also be perfect (having both stamens and carpels) or imperfect (having only stamens or carpels).

                // Note on bryophyta
                plantae: `
                    <h2>Review of Plant Kigdom III</h2>
                    <h1>Bryophyta & Pteridophyta</h1>
                    <p>The Kingdom Plantae includes all living and extinct plants. Plants are multicellular, primarily photosynthetic eukaryotes, mostly adapted to land life. They are classified based on various factors such as structure, reproduction, and evolutionary history.

<h2>Division Bryophyta</h2>
<p>Bryophytes are non-vascular plants, which means they lack specialized tissues (xylem and phloem) for water and nutrient transport. They are considered the simplest and most primitive land plants. Bryophytes include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. They have a dominant gametophyte stage in their life cycle, with the sporophyte dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition.</P>

<h3><i><b>Marchantia polymorpha </i>(A Liverwort)</b></h3>
Structure:

<p><b>Thallus:</b> The plant body of Marchantia polymorpha is a flattened, lobed structure called a thallus. It has a dichotomous branching pattern, meaning it splits into two equal branches repeatedly.
Rhizoids: These are hair-like structures that anchor the thallus to the substrate and help in water and nutrient absorption.
Gemmae Cups: Small cup-like structures on the thallus surface, containing gemmae (small discs of tissue) used for asexual reproduction.</p>
Reproduction:

<p><b>Asexual Reproduction:</b> Occurs through gemmae dispersed from the gemmae cups by rainwater splashes.</p>
<p><b>Sexual Reproduction:</b> Involves the formation of male and female sex organs on separate plants.<br>
Antheridia: Male sex organs that produce motile sperm.<br>
Archegonia: Female sex organs that produce eggs.</p>
Fertalization
<p>Fertilization occurs when water facilitates the movement of sperm to the archegonia, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote, which grows into a sporophyte.</p>

<h3><i><b>Funaria hygrometrica</i> (A Moss)</b></h3>
External Morphology:

<p><b>Gametophyte:</b> The green, leafy structure that is the dominant phase of the moss life cycle. The leaves are arranged spirally around a central stem.
Rhizoids: Multi-cellular, root-like structures that anchor the plant and absorb water and nutrients.</p>
Reproduction:

<p><b>Asexual Reproduction:</b> Occurs through fragmentation or the production of specialized structures called protonemata, which give rise to new gametophytes.</p>
<p><b>Sexual Reproduction:</b> Involves distinct male and female gametophytes.<br>
Antheridia: Male reproductive organs that produce biflagellate sperm.<br>
Archegonia: Female reproductive organs that contain a single egg.</p><br>

Fertilization and Sporophyte:
<p>Fertilization is facilitated by water, allowing sperm to swim to the egg in the archegonia.
The fertilized egg develops into a sporophyte, which remains attached to the gametophyte.
Sporophyte Structure consist of:<br>
Seta: A long stalk that elevates the capsule.<br>
Capsule: The spore-producing structure, containing spores that are released to germinate into new protonemata, completing the life cycle.</p>

<h2>Division Pteridophyta</h2>
<p>Pteridophytes are vascular plants that do not produce seeds. They have specialized tissues for water and nutrient transport (xylem and phloem). Pteridophytes include ferns, horsetails, and club mosses.</p>

Morphology:

<p><b>Sporophyte Dominance:</b> The dominant phase in their life cycle, with the gametophyte being much reduced.<br>
<b>Leaves (Fronds):</b> Typically large and divided, especially in ferns.<br>
<b>Roots:</b> Well-developed and capable of absorbing water and nutrients efficiently.<br>
<b>Stems:</b> Can be underground (rhizomes) or above ground.</p>

Classes of Pteridophyta:
<p> Class Psilopsida (Whisk Ferns)<br>
Class Lycopsida (Club Mosses)<br>
Class Sphenopsida (Horsetails)<br>
Class Filicinae (True Ferns)</p>
General Characteristics of Class Filicinae:
<p>
1. They are perennial plants<br>
2. Their vegetative body consists of a rhizome (a subterranean stem) which sends out aerial leaves (called fronds)<br>
3. Adventitious roots are borne on the rhizome.<br>
4 The aerial leaves (or fronds) are with long petioles.<br>
5 The fronds are either pinnutely or bi-pinnately compound, cach consisting of a main axis (called rachis) bearing leaflets called pinnae. Each pinna is subdivided into pinnules<br>
6. Petrole is covered by brownish hairs called ramenta<br>
7 The fronds when young show circinate vernation i.c. rolled up young blade developing by unfolding from the base to the apex.<br>
8. They produce multi-flagellated sperims<br>
9 They produce independem gametophyte (green in colour)<br>
Sub-class Leptosporangiatae: In the members of this subclass, the sporangium develops from a single mitral.</p>

<h3><b>Order Filicales (True Ferns)</b></h3>
Morphology:

<p><b>Fronds:</b> Typically large, divided leaves with a characteristic coiled arrangement (circinate vernation) in young fronds.<br>
<b>Rhizomes:</b> Horizontal underground stems that give rise to fronds and roots.<br>
<b>Roots:</b> Adventitious roots that arise from the rhizome.</p>
Life Cycle:

<p><b>Sporophyte Stage:</b> The dominant phase with well-developed fronds.<br>
<b>Sporangia and Sori:</b> Sporangia produce haploid spores and are clustered in sori on the underside of fronds.<br>
<b>Spore Dispersal:</b> Spores are released and germinate to form a small, heart-shaped gametophyte called a prothallus.<br>
<b>Gametophyte Stage:</b> The prothallus is small and short-lived, producing antheridia and archegonia.<br>
<b>Fertilization:</b> Motile sperm swim to the egg in the archegonium, facilitated by water.<br>
<b>Zygote Formation:</b> The fertilized egg develops into a new sporophyte, growing from the prothallus and eventually becoming independent.</p>

<h2>The Prothallus (Gametophyte)</h2>
<p>The prothallus is the gametophyte stage in the life cycle of ferns and other pteridophytes. It is a crucial part of the alternation of generations, representing the haploid (n) phase where gametes (sperm and eggs) are produced.</p>

Structure:

<p><b>Shape and Size:</b> The prothallus is typically small, heart-shaped, and photosynthetic, usually measuring a few millimeters in diameter.<br>
<b>Thalloid Nature:</b> It is a simple, thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true leaves, stems, or roots.<br>
<b>Rhizoids:</b> These are hair-like structures that anchor the prothallus to the substrate and aid in water and nutrient absorption.</p>
Reproductive Structures:

<p><b>Antheridia:</b> These are the male reproductive organs found on the lower surface of the prothallus. They produce motile sperm cells.<br>
<b>Archegonia:</b> These are the female reproductive organs, also located on the lower surface but typically near the notch of the heart-shaped prothallus. Each archegonium contains a single egg cell.<p>
Fertilization:

<p><b>Water Requirement:</b> Fertilization in the prothallus requires water, as the sperm cells are motile and need a film of water to swim from the antheridia to the archegonia.<br>
<b>Zygote Formation:</b> When a sperm cell reaches an archegonium, it fertilizes the egg, forming a diploid (2n) zygote. This zygote then develops into the sporophyte.</p>
Significance:

<p><b>Transition to Sporophyte:</b> The prothallus plays a critical role in the life cycle by providing the initial environment for the young sporophyte, which eventually becomes the dominant, vascular plant.<br>
<b>Photosynthesis:</b> As a photosynthetic structure, the prothallus can produce its own food, though it is typically short-lived compared to the sporophyte.<p><br><br><br><br>

                    <h2>Review of the Animal Kingdom I</h2>
                    <h1>Sarcomastigophora - PLlatyhelminthes</h1>
                    <h2>Classification Overview</h2>
<p>The earliest efforts at natural classification were based on three lines of investigation: comparative morphology, comparative anatomy, and paleontology. These have since been supplemented by comparative physiology, cytology, genetics, serology, ecology, and geography. However, morphology and anatomy remain the most widely used methods for animal classification.<br>

This classification covers major groupings, from sarcomastigophorans to chordates, arranged in increasing order of complexity.</p>

<h3>Phylum Sarcomastigophora</h3>
<b>Characteristics:</b><br/>
<p>-Single type of nucleus.<br>
-Locomotory organelles include flagella and pseudopodia.</p>
<b>Sub-Phyla:</b><br>
<P><b>Sarcodina (Amoebae):</b><br>
Locomotion by pseudopodia.
Four types of pseudopodia: <br>
-<b>Lobopodia (e.g., Amoeba):</b> Blunt and broad<br>
-<b>Filopodia (e.g., Plystomella):</b> Thin and long<br>
-<b>Reticulopodia (e.g., Allogonia):</b> Thin and branching network<br>
-<b>Axopodia (e.g., Actinomorpha):</b> Thin and canal support</p>

<p><b>Mastigophora (Flagellates):</b>
Locomotion,food collector and sensory nerves by flagella.<br>
Divided into <br>
-<b>Phytoflagellates (e.g., Euglena)</b>: Contain chomophores and are autothropic<br>
-<b>Zooflagellates (e.g., Trypanosoma)</b>: No chromophores, are heterotrophic</p>
NB:  Trypanosoma exhibit polyhorphism. Its polymorps are: 1. Crithrida, 2.Leptomonas, 3.Leishmonia

<p><b>Opalinata:</b>Numerous short, cilia-like flagella.
Usually large, oval, flattened, and leaf-shaped.
Parasites found in the lower alimentary canal of amphibians (e.g., Opalina ramarun).</p>
Reproduction:
<p><b>Asexual reproduction:</b> binary fission, multiple fission, and budding.<br>
<b>Sexual reproduction:</b> involves gametes, either isogametes or anisogametes, and processes like syngamy and conjugation.</p>

<h3>Phylum Apicomplexa</h3>
<b>Characteristics:</b>
<p>Endoparasites without external locomotory devices.
All members are endoparasite(can't live outside host).
They contain spores containing sperozite which s the infective stage.</p>
Example:
<p><b>Plasmodium spp.:</b> Causes malaria, life cycle involves human hosts and Anopheles mosquitoes.</p>

<h3>Phylum Ciliophora(Paramecium)</h3>
Characteristics:
<p>Possess cilia for locomotion and food collection.
Two types of nuclei: macronucleus and micronucleus.</p>
Reproduction:
<p><b>Asexual:</b> transverse binary fission.<br>
<b>Sexual:</b> processes like conjugation, autogamy, and cytogamy.</p>

<h3>Phylum Porifera (Sponges)</h3>
Characteristics:
<p>Cellular level of organization.
Lack of mouth, digestive sac, nervous system, or sense organs.
Endoskeleton made of calcareous, siliceous, or horny spicules.
Sessile animals with intracellular digestion and diffusion-based respiration and excretion.</p>

<h3>Phylum Coelenterata (Cnidaria)</h3>
<p>Cnidarians, also known as coelenterates, are a diverse phylum of aquatic animals known for their distinctive body structures and life cycles. The main characteristics of cnidarians are:<br>

<b>Radial Symmetry:</b> Cnidarians exhibit radial symmetry, meaning their body parts are arranged around a central axis.<br>
<b>Diploblastic:</b> They are diploblastic animals, having two primary tissue layers: the ectoderm (outer layer) and the endoderm (inner layer). Between these layers is a non-living, jelly-like substance called mesoglea.<br>
<b>Body Forms:</b> They exist in two main body forms - the sessile polyp and the free-swimming medusa. Some cnidarians alternate between these two forms during their life cycle.<br>
<b>Gastrovascular Cavity:</b> They possess a central gastrovascular cavity, which serves both digestive and circulatory functions. There is a single opening that functions as both mouth and anus.<br>
<b>Cnidocytes:</b> They have specialized cells called cnidocytes, which contain stinging organelles known as nematocysts. These are used for capturing prey and defense.<br>
<b>Nervous System:</b> Cnidarians have a simple nerve net without a centralized brain.<br>
Reproduction: They can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction typically involves the production of gametes, while asexual reproduction can occur through budding or fragmentation.<br></p>
<b>Classes of Cnidaria</b>
<p>Cnidaria is divided into several classes, each with its unique characteristics:</p>

<b>1.Class Hydrozoa (Hydroids)</b>

<p><b>Body Forms:</b> Hydrozoans typically alternate between polyp and medusa forms. The polyp form is usually dominant.<br>
<b>Colonial or Solitary:</b> Many hydrozoans form colonies, while others are solitary.<br>
<b>Medusa:</b> When present, medusae are usually small and possess a structure called a velum.<br>
<b>Gonads:</b> The gonads are ectodermal in origin.<br
<b>Examples:</b> Hydra (solitary polyp), Obelia (colonial hydroid).</p>
<b>2.Class Scyphozoa (True Jellyfish)</b>

<p><b>Body Forms:</b> The medusa form is dominant and is usually large and bell-shaped. The polyp form is greatly reduced or absent.<br>
<b>Medusa:</b> They lack a velum, and the medusae have thick, gelatinous mesoglea.<br>
<b>Gastrovascular Cavity:</b> The gastrovascular cavity is divided by radial canals and septa.<br>
<b>Gonads:</b> Gonads are located in the gastric cavity.<br>
<b>Examples:</b> Aurelia (moon jellyfish).</p>

<b>3.Class Anthozoa (Sea Anemones and Corals)</b>
<p><b>Body Forms:</b> The polyp form is dominant, and the medusa form is completely absent.<br>
<b>Structure:</b> Polyps are often large and complex, with a central oral disc and hollow tentacles.<br>
<b>Gastrovascular Cavity:</b> The cavity is divided by septa into chambers.<br>
<b>Reproduction:</b> Both sexual and asexual reproduction are common. Polyps can reproduce by budding or fragmentation.<br>
<b>Examples:</b> Metridium (sea anemone), various corals (e.g., Acropora).</p>

<b>Life Cycle:</b>
<p>Involves alternating polyp and medusa stages in species like Obelia.<br>
Hydra undergoes both asexual (budding) and sexual reproduction.</p>

<h3>Phylum Platyhelminthes (Flatworms)</h3>
<b>Characteristics:</b>
<p>Triploblastic, flattened dorsoventrally.<br>
Lack anus, have flame cells for excretion.<br>
Hermaphroditic with complex reproductive systems.</p>

<b>Advancement of Flatworms Over Sponges and Cnidarians</b>
<p>Flatworms (Phylum Platyhelminthes) show several advancements over sponges (Phylum Porifera) and cnidarians (Phylum Cnidaria):<br></p>

<b>Bilateral Symmetry:</b><br>

<p><b>Flatworms:</b> Exhibit bilateral symmetry, which allows for a more streamlined body plan and directional movement.<br>
<b>Sponges and Cnidarians:</b> Sponges have asymmetry or radial symmetry, and cnidarians have radial symmetry.<br></p>
<b>Body Layer:</b>

<p><b>Flatworms:</b> Are triploblastic, having three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), which allows for more complex tissue and organ development.<br>
<b>Sponges:</b> Are considered parazoans, lacking true tissue layers.<br>
<b>Cnidarians:</b> Are diploblastic, having only two germ layers (ectoderm and endoderm).</p>
<b>Organ Systems:</b><br>

<p><b>Flatworms:</b> Possess more developed organ systems, including a primitive excretory system (protonephridia), and a centralized nervous system with a pair of nerve cords and a simple brain (ganglia).<br>
<b>Sponges:</b> Lack organized tissues and organs, relying on simple cell aggregates.<br>
<b>Cnidarians:</b> Have a simple nerve net and a gastrovascular cavity but lack more complex organ systems.</p>

<b>Cephalization:</b><br>
<p><b>Flatworms:</b> Exhibit cephalization, the concentration of sensory organs and nerve cells at the anterior end, which is a significant step toward more complex nervous systems.<br>
<b>Sponges and Cnidarians:</b> Lack cephalization, with nerve cells more diffusely distributed.</p>
<b>Acoelomate Body Plan:</b><br>
<p><b>Flatworms:</b> Have an acoelomate body plan (no body cavity), but the presence of mesoderm allows for more complex tissues.<br>
<b>Sponges and Cnidarians:</b> Sponges lack body cavities, and cnidarians have a simple body cavity (gastrovascular cavity) but no mesoderm.</p>

<b>Classes:</b>
<p><b>Turbellaria:</b> Turbellarians are mostly free-living flatworms, predominantly found in marine environments.<br> They have a ciliated and glandular surface with a thin cuticle and lack proglottides and suckers.<br> An example is Planaria, which has a simple digestive system with a ventral mouth and a tubular pharynx for capturing food.<br><br>

<b>Temnocephalida:</b> Members of this class possess anterior tentacles and a simple sac-like gut.<br> They lose their external ciliated layer during development and are direct developers.<br> An example is Temnocephala, which inhabits the bronchial chamber of freshwater crustaceans.<br><br>

<b>Monogenea:</b> These are specialized parasites that live on a single host throughout their life.<br> They attach to their hosts using elaborate adhesive organs called haptors, which often have suckers or hooks.<br> Examples include Polystoma, which parasitizes the urinary bladder of toads and frogs.<br><br>

<b>Trematoda:</b> Commonly known as flukes, these are mostly endoparasitic flatworms.<br> They lack cilia and have suckers for attachment.<br> Their bodies are covered by a thick cuticle and are typically leaf-shaped.<br> Examples include Fasciola gigantica, which inhabits the liver of cattle and sheep, and Schistosoma sp., which causes schistosomiasis.<br><br>

<b>Cestodaria:</b> This small group of unsegmented flatworms lacks a digestive tract and a scolex but has an anterior proboscis.<br> The larva, called lycophore, has five pairs of hooks and the adults typically parasitize the intestines or body cavities of fishes.<br> An example is Amphilina.<br><br>

<b>Cestoda:</b> These are endoparasitic tapeworms characterized by the absence of a gut and the presence of suckers and hooks for attachment.<br> Their bodies are segmented into proglottides.<br> The segments closest to the neck are newly formed while the oldest and sexually mature segments lie farthest from the scolex.<br> An example is Taenia sp., which infects the intestines of vertebrates.</p>

<b>Reproduction:</b>
<p><b>Tapeworms</b> reproduce both sexually and asexually. Adult tapeworms in the host's intestine produce segments (proglottides) that contain reproductive organs. These segments, filled with eggs, are released with feces. Intermediate hosts ingest the eggs, where larvae develop and encyst. When a definitive host consumes the encysted larvae, they mature into adult tapeworms in the intestine.<br><br>

<b>Turbellarians</b>, such as Planaria, reproduce asexually by splitting into two and regenerating the missing parts. Sexually, they are hermaphroditic and exchange sperm with another individual. Fertilized eggs are enclosed in capsules, developing into young flatworms.<br><br>

<b>Fasciola</b>, a liver fluke, has a complex life cycle involving multiple hosts. Adult flukes in the liver of cattle or sheep lay eggs that are expelled with feces. Eggs hatch into miracidia in water, which infect snails. Inside snails, they develop into cercariae that encyst on vegetation. When the vegetation is ingested by a definitive host, the metacercariae excyst and develop into adult flukes in the liver.</p>

<b>Life Cycle of Ascaris</b>
<p>The life cycle of Ascaris lumbricoides starts with adults residing in the human small intestine. Females lay eggs that are expelled with feces and become infective in soil. Humans ingest the embryonated eggs through contaminated food or water. The larvae hatch in the small intestine, travel through the bloodstream to the liver, heart, and lungs, then migrate up the trachea, are swallowed, and mature into adults in the small intestine. The cycle takes about 60-75 days.</p>

                    <h2>Review of Animal Kingdom IV</h2>
                    <h1>Chordata, Hemichordata - Pieces</h1>
                    <b>Phylum Chordata Characteristics:</b>

<p>-Highest phylum in the animal kingdom<br>
-Triploblastic, multicellular, bilaterally symmetrical, metamerically segmented, and coelomate<br>
-Includes sea squirts, acorn worms, and humans</p>
<b>Four fundamental characteristics:</b>
<p><b>1. Notochord (chorda dorsalis):</b><br>
-Axial stiffening rod along the animal's length<br>
-Located between the alimentary canal and dorsal cord of the central nervous system<br>
-May persist throughout life or be replaced by a vertebral column in vertebrates<br>
<b>2. Gill pouches or clefts:</b><br>
-Develop near the anterior end on the sides of the embryonic pharynx<br>
-Become functional gill slits in aquatic vertebrates, but lost in terrestrial vertebrates<br>
<b>3. Central nervous system:</b><br>
-Dorsal in position, hollow, fluid-filled, and tubular<br>
-Anteriorly differentiated into a brain in advanced forms<br>
<b>4. Circulatory system:</b><br>
-Blood circulation maintained by a ventral heart<br>
-Heart contained within a pericardial cavity in higher chordates</p>

<b>Additional Chordate Characteristics:</b>
<p>Possession of a postanal tail</p>

Divided into four main sub-phyla: Hemichordata, Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata

<h3>Sub-Phylum Hemichordata:</h3>
<b>Characteristics</b>
<p>- Marine, worm-like animals<br>
- Body divided into preoral lobe (proboscis), collar, and trunk<br>
- Simple blood system, stomochord representing the notochord<br>
- Indirect development with tornaria larva<br>
- Examples: Balanoglossus (acorn worms), Cephalodiscus</p>

<h3>Sub-Phylum Urochordata (Tunicata):</h3>
<p>- Unsegmented marine chordates<br>
- Notochord present only in larval form, confined to the tail<br>
- Main cavity reminiscent of the haemocoel of arthropods<br>
- Possess a cellulose-containing tunic</p>
<b>Classes:</b>
<p>1. Class Asidiacea <br>
2. Class Larvacea <br>
3. Class Thaliacea</p>
<b>Examples:</b> <p> Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt), Oikopleura</p>
<h3>Sub-Phylum Cephalochordata:</h3>

<p>Small, fish-like animals with a notochord extending the entire body length</p>
Examples: <p>Branchiostoma nigeriensis (lancelet)</p>

<h3>Sub-Phylum Vertebrata</h3>
<p>Vertebrates have a series of cartilaginous or bony vertebrae that replace or reinforce the notochord. <br>
A typical vertebrate body is divided into three regions: head, trunk, and tail.<br>
The head bears the mouth and sensory organs, including olfactory organs, paired eyes, a median dorsal pineal eye, and semicircular canals for balance, indicating cephalization.<br> 
Vertebrates have a cranium or skull and a complex brain with at least ten pairs of cranial nerves.<br> 
Most visceral organs are located in the trunk. The alimentary canal is complete, with an anus located some distance before the posterior end, and associated structures like the liver and pancreas are present.<br>
The ventral heart, contained in a pericardial cavity, has three or four chambers.<br> 
Respiratory surfaces include gills in aquatic forms or lungs in terrestrial forms. <br>
There is typically a single pair of gonads with ducts closely associated with those of the kidneys. <br>
The exoskeleton varies among classes (scales, feathers, hair).</p>

Vertebrates are divided into two groups based on appendages: 
<p>Pisces (with fins) and Tetrapoda (with limbs).</p> They can also be categorized into: <p>Jawless (Superclass Agnatha or Cyclostomata) and jawed vertebrates (Superclass Gnathostomata).</p>

<h3>Superclass Agnatha or Cyclostomata</h3>
<p>These jawless fishes include lampreys and hagfishes. <br>
They have a long, slender, cylindrical body, are scaleless, and eel-like. <br>
The mouth is suctorial with a rasping tongue, surrounded by tentacles or an adhesive disc. <br>
Paired fins are absent, and median fins are present. <br>
They have five to sixteen pairs of gills. <br>
Fertilization is external, and development can be direct (hagfishes) or involve a long larval stage (lampreys). <br>
An example is Lampetra fluviatilis, which is semi-ectoparasitic on fishes.</p>

<h3>Superclass Gnathostomata</h3>
<p>Gnathostomes have jaws formed from the mandibular visceral arch, paired limbs, and three semicircular canals in the ear. <br>
Fishes are lower gnathostomes, all aquatic with a streamlined body and muscular tail for propulsion. <br>
The body is covered with bony scales. <br>
Fishes are divided into three major classes: <br>
1. Class Placodermi<br>
2. Class Chondrichthyes<br> 
3. Class Osteichthyes.</p>

<b>Class Placodermi</b>
<p>Placoderms had heavy, defensive armor of bony plates and are now extinct. <br>
Examples include Acanthodes and Coccosteus.</p>

<b>Class Chondrichthyes (Elasmobranchii)</b>
<p>Chondrichthyes have a cartilaginous skeleton with placoid scales and include sharks, skates, and rays. <br>
They have a heterocercal tail fin, median and paired fins, and no air bladder. <br>
Respiration is by five to seven pairs of gills. <br>
Fertilization is internal, and they are anamniote with direct development. <br>
Examples include the sharp-nosed shark (Scoliodon terraenovae).</p>

<b>Class Osteichthyes</b>
<p>Osteichthyes have a bony skeleton and include the majority of fishes. <br>
They have bony scales, paired and median fins, and a homocercal tail. <br>
Respiration is by four pairs of gills covered by an operculum. <br>
They possess a gas bladder for buoyancy. <br>
Fertilization is external, and they are oviparous. <br>
Subclasses include Dipnoi (lungfishes), Crossopterygii (lobe-finned fishes), and Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes). <br>
Examples include Protopterus (lungfish) and Latimeria (coelacanth).</p>

                    <h1>Introductory Ecology</h1>
                    <h2>Ecology and Environment</h2>

<b>What is Ecology?</b><br>
<p>Ecology Study of organisms' relationships with their physical (abiotic) and living (biotic) environments.</p>
<B>What is the Environment</b><br>
<p>Environment Total of all conditions affecting an organism, including physical (water, sunlight, temperature, etc.) and biotic components (living organisms).</p>

<b>Ecological Concepts</b>
<p><b>1. Biosphere:</b> Part of Earth inhabitable by living organisms.<br>
<b>2. Lithosphere:</b> Earth's solid components.<br>
<b>3.Hydrosphere:</b> Liquid components of the biosphere.<br>
<b>4. Atmosphere:</b> Mixture of gases surrounding Earth.<br>
<b>5. Habitat:</b> Specific place where an organism is found.<br>
<b>6. Niche:</b> Biological status of an organism in its community.<br>
<b>7. Community:</b> All living populations in a habitat.<br>
<b>8. Population:</b> Group of interacting individuals of the same species.<br>
<b>9. Ecosystem:</b> Community and its physical environment considered together.</p>

<B>Ecological Factors</b>
<p><b>Abiotic Facrors (Physical Factors):</b> Temperature, water, light, humidity, wind/air currents, pH, mineral salts, water currents, salinity, wave action, and topography.<Br>
<b>Biotic Factors:</b> Predation, competition, parasitism, and other organism interactions.</P>

<b>Food Chain and Food Web</b><br><br>
<b>Food Chain</b><br>
Definition:<p> A food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass as one organism eats another.</p><br>
Structure:
<p><b>Producers:</b> Usually plants or other photosynthetic organisms that produce their own food using sunlight.<br>
<b>Primary Consumers:</b> Herbivores that eat producers.<br>
<b>Secondary Consumers:</b> Carnivores that eat herbivores.<br>
<b>Tertiary Consumers:</b> Carnivores that eat other carnivores.<br>
<b>Decomposers:</b> Organisms such as bacteria and fungi that break down dead organisms and recycle nutrients back into the ecosystem.</p>
Example:
<p>Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Hawk.</p>
Energy Flow:
<p>Energy decreases at each trophic level due to loss of energy as heat and metabolic processes.</P><br>

<b>Food Web</b><br>
Definition:<p> A food web is a complex network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.</p>
Structure:
<p><b>Multiple Pathways:</b> Unlike food chains, food webs have multiple pathways for energy flow.<br>
<b>Interconnected Chains:</b> Organisms are part of multiple food chains, creating a web of interactions.</p>

Example:
<P>Grass is eaten by rabbits, grasshoppers, and deer. Rabbits are eaten by foxes and hawks, while grasshoppers are eaten by frogs and birds.</p>
Stability:
<p>Food webs provide more stability to an ecosystem because multiple species occupy different trophic levels, ensuring that energy can flow through multiple pathways if one species is removed or reduced.</p>

Biodiversity:
<p>Food webs demonstrate the biodiversity of an ecosystem, showing the various species and their interactions.</p><br>

Comparison
<p><b>Simplicity:</b> Food chains are simpler, showing a single path of energy flow, while food webs are complex and show multiple pathways.
<B>Dependency:</b> Food chains show direct dependency of organisms, while food webs demonstrate interdependency among various organisms.
<b>Ecosystem Representation:</b> Food webs provide a more accurate representation of natural ecosystems due to their complexity and multiple interactions.</p>

Importance
<p><b>Energy Transfer:</b> Both food chains and food webs illustrate how energy is transferred from one organism to another in an ecosystem.
<b>Ecological Balance:</b> They help in understanding the ecological balance and the role of each organism within an ecosystem.
<b>Biodiversity:</b> Highlight the importance of biodiversity and how different species contribute to the stability and sustainability of ecosystems.</P><br>

<b>Trophic Levels:</b><p> Feeding levels in a food chain/web.</p>
<b>Ecological Pyramids:</b> <p>Pyramids of numbers and biomass reflecting energy loss at each level.</p>

                    <h2> Group I-III</h2>
                    <h3> Group I Elements</h3>

    
    <b> Electronic Structure</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Lithium Li = [He] 2s<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>Sodium Na = [Ne] 3s<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>Potassium K = [Ar] 4s<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>Rubidium Rb = [Kr] 5s<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>Caesium Cs = [Xe] 6s<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>Francium Fr = [Xe] 7s<sup>1</sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) are all group IA elements, also known as the alkali metals.<br>
        These metals are silvery-gray (except for cesium, which is yellow), soft, and good conductors of heat and electricity.<br>
        Their high thermal conductivity and relatively low melting points make them suitable for specific applications like heat-transfer fluids in nuclear reactors.
    </p>
    <p>
        All these metal atoms contain a single electron outside a noble-gas configuration. <Br>
        The large volume of each atom results in a low density, allowing Li, Na, and K to float on water. <br>
        These metals easily lose their single valence electron to form +1 ions, making them strong reducing agents. <br>
        They are quite reactive and can even reduce water.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chemistry of alkali metals is confined to the +1 oxidation state due to the large second-ionization energies required to remove a second electron. Hydrogen, though it shares some similarities, is not typically included in this group. Francium is usually omitted due to its radioactivity and scarcity.
    </p>
    
    <b>Occurrence</b>
    <ul>
        <p><li>Lithium is most commonly extracted from the mineral spodumene.</li>
        <li>Sodium occurs as the mineral rock salt (NaCl) and in lakes and sea water.</li>
        <li>Potassium occurs naturally as potash and camellite.</li>
        <li>Rubidium and caesium occur as minor constituents of the mineral lepidolite.</li></p>
    </ul>
    
    <b> Chemical Reactions and Compounds</b>
    <p>
        1. The elements react violently with water, producing hydrogen gas and metal hydroxides:
    </p>
    <p>
        2M(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → 2MOH(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)
    </p>
    <p>
       2. They also react swiftly with oxygen to form oxides, peroxides, and superoxides:
    </p>
    <p>
        4M(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2M<sub>2</sub>O(s)

        Group IIA elements are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra).<br> These metals are harder and less reactive than the alkali metals.<Br> They are called alkaline-earth metals because many of their compounds are basic or alkaline.
    </p>
    <p>
        These metals have two valence electrons and typically form +2 ions. <br>
        They become more reactive as you move down the group, with higher melting points and greater hardness compared to Group IA elements.

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Occurrence and Electronic Structure</h2>
    <p>The elements in Group IVA can be divided into three classes: <strong>carbon</strong>, which is a nonmetal; <strong>silicon</strong> and <strong>germanium</strong>, which are semimetals; and <strong>tin</strong> and <strong>lead</strong>, which are metals. Tin and lead are among the oldest metals known and are much less reactive than any of the groups IA, IIA, or IIIA metals. According to the periodic table trends, lead should be more reactive than tin, but this is not the case. The group IVA elements all have ns<sup>2</sup> np<sup>2</sup> valence electron configurations. All form compounds where they lose either the two np and the two ns valence electrons or just the two np valence electrons, giving a +4 or +2 oxidation state, respectively.</p>
    <p>The elements of Group IVA show a greater range of chemical behavior than any other family in the periodic table. Three of the five elements, <strong>carbon</strong>, <strong>tin</strong>, and <strong>lead</strong>, have been known since ancient times. Tin and lead oxides and sulfides are easily reduced to the metal by heating with charcoal. Because tin and copper ores are often found together, their alloy-bronze-was probably discovered before either element, leading to the Bronze Age. Although the first glasses were prepared from silica (silicon oxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>) around 1500 BC, elemental silicon was not prepared until 1824 due to its high affinity for oxygen. The last member of Group IVA to be discovered was <strong>germanium</strong>, found in 1886 by Clemens Winkler.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Preparation and General Properties</h2>
    <p>The natural abundance of the Group IVA elements varies greatly. <strong>Carbon</strong> ranks only 17th in Earth's crust. Pure graphite is obtained by reacting coke with silica to give silicon carbide (SiC), which is then decomposed at very high temperatures to give graphite. One allotrope of carbon, diamond, is metastable under normal conditions but is the most stable form at pressures greater than 50,000 atm.</p>
    <p>Pure <strong>silicon</strong> is obtained by reacting impure silicon with Cl<sub>2</sub> to give SiCl<sub>4</sub>, followed by fractional distillation and reduction with H<sub>2</sub>. <strong>Germanium</strong> and <strong>tin</strong> are found in very low concentrations in Earth's crust. <strong>Lead</strong>, the end product of the nuclear decay of many radionuclides, is more abundant at 13 ppm. Pure lead is obtained by heating galena (PbS) in air and reducing the oxide (PbO) to the metal with carbon, followed by electrolytic deposition to increase purity.</p>
    <p>Many carbon compounds contain multiple bonds formed by overlap of singly occupied 2p orbitals on adjacent atoms. The tendency to form chains of like atoms decreases rapidly down Group IVA because bond energies decrease with increasing atomic number. The stability of catenated compounds decreases from carbon to lead.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Reactions and Compounds of Carbon</h2>
    <p><strong>Carbon</strong> is the building block of all organic compounds, including biomolecules, fuels, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. Inorganic carbon compounds include metal carbonates, halides, oxides, carbides, and carboranes. The structures of carbon allotropes-diamond, graphite, fullerenes, and nanotubes-are distinct but all contain simple electron-pair bonds. Carbon reacts with oxygen to form CO or CO<sub>2</sub> depending on stoichiometry. Carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless, and poisonous gas, reacts with iron in hemoglobin, preventing oxygen transport. In the laboratory, CO can be prepared by dehydrating formic acid with concentrated sulfuric acid. Carbon dioxide is prepared by reacting metal carbonates or bicarbonates with strong acids. Binary compounds of carbon with less electronegative elements are called carbides.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Reactions and Compounds of the Heavier Group IVA Elements</h2>
    <p><strong>Silicon</strong> and <strong>germanium</strong> are semiconductors with structures analogous to diamond. Tin has two common allotropes: white tin with a metallic lattice and gray tin with a diamond-like structure. Lead is metallic under all conditions. Silicon is amphoteric, while germanium behaves more like a metal. Tin and lead are more metallic and exhibit a variety of oxidation states. The stability of +2 oxidation states increases from carbon to lead due to decreasing bond strength and increasing ionization energy.</p>
    <p>The oxides of Group IVA elements become increasingly basic down the group. Silicon-oxygen bonds are unusually strong, dominating silicon's chemistry. Silicon and germanium react with nitrogen at high temperatures to form nitrides. Silicon nitride is used in high-temperature engineering applications. Silicides of active metals are ionic and react with aqueous acid to form silicon hydrides.</p>

        <li><strong>Carbon</strong>: Diamond powder for heat transfer in electronic devices, carbon nanotubes for ultramicroscale detectors and molecular computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Silicon</strong>: Semiconductors in electronics, silicon-oxygen compounds in construction materials.</li>

<h1>Group 5A Elements</h1>
    <p>Group 5A (Group 15) consists of five elements: nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. These elements are known as the nitrogen family or pnictogens, and their compounds are often suffocating with a pungent smell, which is why they are also referred to as pnictides.</p>
    <p>These elements are generally not abundant in nature, except for nitrogen, which makes up about 80% of the Earth's atmosphere (four-fifths of air volume) and is mainly found as nitrates. Phosphorus, being highly reactive, does not occur in its native state but is found in nature as calcium phosphate (Ca₃(PO₄)₂) or apatite (CaF₂·Ca₃(PO₄)₂), which is a combination of calcium fluoride and calcium phosphate. Both nitrogen and phosphorus cannot be detected by flame tests because they are nonmetals. The elements arsenic, antimony, and bismuth are less abundant and are primarily found in sulfide ores such as arsenical pyrites (FeAsS), arsenic sulfide (As₂S₃), stibnite (Sb₂S₃), and bismuth glance (Bi₂S₃).</p>

    <h2> Physical Properties</h2>
    <p>The physical properties of Group 5A elements change regularly with the increase in atomic number and size.</p>

    <h3>Graduation of Metallic and Nonmetallic Properties</h3>
    <p>The metallic character increases as we move down the group. Even though bismuth is a metal, its electrical conductivity is weak, which makes the properties of Group 5A elements lean more towards nonmetals.</p>

    <h3>Different Number of Molecular Atoms</h3>
    <p>The number of atoms in the molecules of each element in this group varies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nitrogen: N₂ (two atoms)</li>
        <li>Phosphorus: P₄ (four atoms)</li>
        <li>Arsenic: As₄ (four atoms)</li>
        <li>Antimony: Sb₄ (four atoms)</li>
        <li>Bismuth: Bi₂ (diatomic in vapor state)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite being a metal, bismuth has low electrical conductivity and forms diatomic molecules in its vapor state, unlike other metals which typically have monoatomic structures.</p>

    <h3>Atomic and Ionic Radii</h3>
    <p>Covalent and ionic radii increase down the group. There is a significant increase in covalent radii from nitrogen to phosphorus, with a smaller increase from arsenic to bismuth due to the presence of filled d- or f-orbitals in heavier elements.</p>

    <h3>Ionization Energy</h3>
    <p>Ionization energy decreases down the group due to the increase in atomic size. Group 5A elements have higher ionization energy than Group 4A elements due to their smaller size, and higher than Group 6A elements because of their stable electronic configuration with half-filled p-orbitals.</p>

    <h3>Allotropy</h3>
    <p>All Group 5A elements except nitrogen exhibit allotropy, where an element can exist in different forms with different physical properties but similar chemical properties.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Phosphorus: White (waxy), red, violet</li>
        <li>Arsenic: Black, grey, yellow (waxy yellow)</li>
        <li>Antimony: Yellow, black</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nitrogen and bismuth do not exhibit allotropy because nitrogen is a gaseous nonmetal and bismuth is a metal, and gases and metals generally do not have allotropic forms.</p>

    <h3>Density</h3>
    <p>Density increases as we move down the group.</p>

    <h2> Chemical Properties</h2>

    <h3>Oxidation States</h3>
    <p>The common oxidation states for Group 5A elements are +3, +5, and -3. The tendency to exhibit a -3 oxidation state decreases down the group due to decreasing electronegativity. The stability of the +5 oxidation state decreases while the stability of the +3 oxidation state increases due to the inert pair effect. Nitrogen shows oxidation states from -3 to +5 and, along with phosphorus, exhibits oxidation and reduction in acidic media.</p>

    <h3>Reactivity Towards Hydrogen</h3>
    <p>Group 5A elements form trihydrides (MH₃) with sp³ hybridization. The stability of these hydrides decreases down the group due to decreasing bond dissociation energy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Boiling point order: PH₃ < AsH₃ < NH₃ < SbH₃ < BiH₃</li>
        <li>Boiling point increases with increasing molecular size due to van der Waals forces, with NH₃ having a higher boiling point due to hydrogen bonding.</li>
        <li>Bond angle: NH₃ (107.8°) > PH₃ (99.5°) > AsH₃ (91.8°) ≈ SbH₃ (91.3°) > BiH₃ (90°)</li>
        <li>Basicity: NH₃ > PH₃ > AsH₃ > SbH₃ > BiH₃</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reducing power of hydrides increases down the group due to decreasing bond dissociation energy.</p>

    <h3>Reactivity Towards Oxygen</h3>
    <p>Group 5A elements form trioxides (M₂O₃) and pentoxides (M₂O₅). The acidic character of oxides decreases and basicity increases down the group due to increasing atomic size.</p>

    <h3>Reactivity Towards Halogens</h3>
    <p>Group 5A elements form trihalides and pentahalides. Trihalides are covalent and become more ionic down the group, with sp³ hybridization and pyramidal shapes. Pentahalides exhibit sp³d hybridization and trigonal bipyramidal shapes and are Lewis acids due to the presence of vacant d-orbitals.</p>
    <p>For example, phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) is ionic in the solid state as [PCl₄]+[PCl₆]−, with three equatorial and two axial positions.</p>

    <b>Anomalous behaviour of nitrogen</b><br><br>

The behaviour of nitrogen differs from rest of the elements due to the following reasons:

<p>i. It has a small size.</p>

<p>ii. It does not have d-orbitals.</p>

<p>iii. It has high electronegativity</p>

<p>iv. It has high ionization enthalpy</p>

                    <h2>Group VI-VIII</h2>
                    <h1>Group 6A (Group 16) Elements</h1>

<p>In addition to oxygen, the other group 6A elements are sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The initial four elements of the group are together termed as chalcogens or ore-forming elements. This is because an extensive number of metal ores are found in the earth's crust as sulfides or oxides. Oxygen is the most plenteous element that is accessible in nature. It occurs as silicates and different compounds like carbonates, oxides, and sulfates. Sulfur in its combined state is found in ores.</p>

<p>The chalcogens are the first group in the p block to have no stable metallic elements. All isotopes of polonium (Po), the only metal in group 16, are radioactive, and only one element in the group, tellurium (Te), can even be described as a semimetal.</p>

<p>With their ns²np⁴ electron configurations, the chalcogens are two electrons short of a filled valence shell. Thus, in reactions with metals, they tend to acquire two additional electrons to form compounds in the -2 oxidation state. This tendency is greatest for oxygen, the chalcogen with the highest electronegativity. </p>

<p>Oxygen is by far the most abundant element in Earth's crust and in the hydrosphere (about 44% and 86% by mass, respectively). The same process that is used to obtain nitrogen from the atmosphere produces pure oxygen. Oxygen can also be obtained by the electrolysis of water, the decomposition of alkali metal or alkaline earth peroxides or superoxides, or the thermal decomposition of simple inorganic salts, such as potassium chlorate in the presence of a catalytic amount of MnO<sub>2</sub>:</p>

<p>2KClO<sub>3</sub>(s) <sub>MnO<sub>2</sub></sub> → 2KCl(s) + 3O<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>



<h2>14.6.1 Electronic Configuration</h2>

<p>Group 6A elements have 6 electrons in their valence shell and their general electronic configuration is ns²np⁴.</p>

<h2>14.6.2 Physical Properties</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Atomic and Ionic Radii:</strong> The atomic and ionic radius increases as we move from oxygen to polonium.</li>
    <li><strong>Ionization Enthalpy:</strong> Ionization enthalpy decreases with increase in the size of the central atom. Therefore, it decreases as we move from oxygen to polonium since the size of the atom increases as we move down.</li>
    <li><strong>Electronegativity:</strong> The electronegativity decreases as we move down the group. Therefore, it decreases as we move from oxygen to polonium due to increase in nuclear size.</li>
    <li><strong>Nature of the Group 6A Elements:</strong> Oxygen and sulfur are non-metals, selenium and tellurium are metalloids, and polonium is a metal under typical conditions. Polonium is a radioactive element.</li>
    <li><strong>Allotropy:</strong> Each one of the elements of group 6A displays allotropy. Oxygen has two allotropes: oxygen and ozone. Sulfur exists as many allotropic forms but only two of them are stable, which are: rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur. Selenium and tellurium are found in both amorphous and crystalline forms.</li>
    <li><strong>Melting and Boiling Points:</strong> As the atomic size increases from oxygen to tellurium, the melting and boiling points also increase. The huge distinction between the melting and boiling points of oxygen and sulfur might be clarified on the premise that oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule while sulfur exists as a polyatomic molecule.</li>
    <li><strong>Oxidation State:</strong> They form -2, +4, and +6 oxidation states. The stability of the -2 oxidation state decreases down the group, and the +4 oxidation state becomes more stable down the group.</li>
</ol>

Fluorine exhibits maximum hexavalent character along with tetravalent and divalent character whereas the rest of the halides exhibit tetravalent or divalent nature of those elements.

                    <h2>Hybridization of Carbon</h2>
    <p>Carbon is a versatile element capable of forming a vast number of compounds due to its ability to form single, double, and triple bonds with various elements. The type of hybridization involved in these bonds will be discussed here.</p>
    
    <h3>Bonding and Electron Configuration</h3>
    <p>Bonding occurs with the valence shell electrons found in the outermost shell. The ground state electron configuration of carbon is:</p>
    <p class="code">1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>Carbon has four valence electrons: two in the 2s subshell and two in the 2p subshell. To maximize bonding, carbon promotes one of its 2s electrons into an empty 2p orbital, forming an excited state:</p>
    <p class="code">1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>1</sup> 2p<sub>x</sub><sup>1</sup> 2p<sub>y</sub><sup>1</sup> 2p<sub>z</sub><sup>1</sup></p>

    <h3>Hybridization Examples</h3>
    <b>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</b>
    <p>The Lewis structure of methane shows four groups around the carbon atom, leading to sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization. The four sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals form a tetrahedral geometry with bond angles of 109.5°.</p>
    
    <b>Ethene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)</b>
    <p>In ethene, the Lewis structure shows three groups around each carbon, leading to sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization. The sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals form a trigonal planar geometry with bond angles of 120°.</p>
    
    <b>Acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>)</b>
    <p>The Lewis structure of acetylene shows two groups around each carbon, leading to sp hybridization. The sp hybrid orbitals form a linear geometry with bond angles of 180°.</p>

    <h3>Bond Strength and Length</h3>
    <p>Sigma (σ) bonds are generally stronger than pi (π) bonds. This is reflected in the bond energies and lengths of carbon-carbon bonds in ethane, ethene, and ethyne:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ethane: Bond energy = 346 kJ/mol, Bond length = 0.154 nm</li>
        <li>Ethene: Bond energy = 598 kJ/mol, Bond length = 0.134 nm</li>
        <li>Ethyne: Bond energy = 813 kJ/mol, Bond length = 0.121 nm</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bond Fission</h3>
    <p>Bond fission can be homolytic or heterolytic. In homolytic fission, each atom retains one electron from the bond, forming radicals. In heterolytic fission, one atom retains both electrons, forming ions.</p>

    <h3>Photochemical Reactions</h3>
    <p>Homolytic fission can be initiated by UV light, leading to radical chain reactions such as the chlorination of methane:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initiation: Cl<sub>2</sub> + hv → 2Cl•</li>
        <li>Propagation: CH<sub>4</sub> + Cl• → CH<sub>3</sub>• + HCl, CH<sub>3</sub>• + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + Cl•</li>
        <li>Termination: Cl• + Cl• → Cl<sub>2</sub></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This mechanism involves initiation, propagation, and termination steps, with radicals playing a key role in the chain reaction.</p>

    <h2>Factors Influencing Organic Reactions</h2>
    <p>Organic reactions are influenced by several factors, including electronic and steric effects. These factors are related to the molecular structure of the compound, with variations in structure leading to variations in reactivity. The reacting molecule has a reaction center to which various substituents are attached. The nature of the reaction center determines the type of reaction, while the nature of the substituents affects reactivity.</p>
    
    <h3>Electronic Effects</h3>
    <p>At some stage in most reactions, the reacting molecule develops either a negative or positive charge. The molecule's reactivity depends on how easily it can accommodate this charge, which is influenced by the electronic effects of the substituents. Substituents can either withdraw or release electrons, helping to accommodate a charge. These effects are categorized into inductive and resonance effects.</p>
    
    b>Inductive Effect</b>
    <p>This type of electron displacement occurs along a chain due to the electronegativity of a substituent on a molecule. It is a permanent effect that decreases with distance from the substituent. Substituents with electron-withdrawing tendencies include -F<sub>e</sub>, -Cl<sub>e</sub>, -Br<sub>e</sub>, -I<sub>e</sub>, -OH<sub>e</sub>, -NH<sub>2</sub>, and -NO<sub>2</sub>, which exhibit a -I effect. Substituents with electron-releasing tendencies include -O, -CO, and alkyl groups, which exhibit a +I effect.</p>
    
    <b>Resonance or Mesomeric Effect</b>
    <p>Resonance involves the delocalization of electrons in molecules or ions, which cannot be adequately represented by a single bond diagram. For example, the carbonate ion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) can be represented by multiple resonance structures, indicating that the electron cloud is spread over all the atoms involved. This delocalization makes the molecule more stable than any single canonical structure.</p>
    
    <h3>Electromeric Effect</h3>
    <p>This temporary effect involves the complete transfer of a shared pair of electrons to one of the atoms joined by a multiple bond. It occurs only in response to an attacking reagent and helps facilitate the reaction.</p>
    
    <h3>Steric Effect</h3>
    <p>Steric effects arise from the size of the substituents attached to the reaction center. Bulky groups can hinder the approach of attacking species, thus affecting the reaction. Crowding at the reaction center can significantly influence reactivity.</p>

     <h1>Organic Acids and Bases</h1>
    <p>
        According to Lowry-Bronsted, an acid is a substance that gives up a proton, and a base is a substance that accepts a proton, while Lewis described an acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron-pair donor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many organic compounds containing oxygen can act as bases and accept protons, such as ethanol and diethyl ether:
    </p>
    <p class="chemical">
        CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup><br>
        (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O + HCl → (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        To be a Lowry-Bronsted acid, a molecule must contain hydrogen. The degree of acidity is determined by the kind of atom holding the hydrogen and its ability to accommodate the electron pair left behind by the departing hydrogen ion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Organic compounds with OH, NH, and SH groups can be Lowry-Bronsted acids. The relative acidity of some organic compounds is as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="chemical">
        RCOOH > ROH > HC≡CH > RH
    </p>
    <p>
        Carboxylic acids tend to release a hydrogen ion faster than alcohols due to resonance stabilization. The resonance is more significant in the carboxylate ion than in the acid, increasing the ionization constant (K<sub>a</sub>).
    </p>
    <h2>Factors Influencing Acidity</h2>
    <p>
        Electron-withdrawing substituents stabilize the anion, increasing acidity, while electron-releasing substituents decrease acidity by intensifying the negative charge.
    </p>
    <p>
        For aromatic acids, substituents like -CH<sub>3</sub>, -OH, and -NH<sub>2</sub> weaken the acid, while -Cl and -NO<sub>2</sub> strengthen it.
    </p>
    <h2>Basicity of Amines</h2>
    <p>
        Amines are more basic than water but less basic than hydroxide ions. The basicity of amines can be compared by measuring their basicity constant (K<sub>b</sub>).
    </p>
    <p class="chemical">
        RNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ RNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Aliphatic amines are stronger bases than ammonia, while aromatic amines are weaker due to resonance stabilization.
    </p>
    <h2>Reagents Used in Chemical Reactions</h2>
    <p>
        Reagents in chemical reactions are classified as electrophilic (electron deficient) or nucleophilic (electron-rich).
    </p>
    <h3>Electrophilic Reagents</h3>
    <p>
        These include positively charged ions or atoms with incomplete outer shells, e.g., Al in AlCl<sub>3</sub> or B in BF<sub>3</sub>.
    </p>
    <h3>Nucleophilic Reagents</h3>
    <p>
        These are electron-rich species that attack electron-deficient centers, such as OH<sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>3</sub>.
    </p>

    </ol>
    <h2>Isomerism</h2>
    <p>
        Isomerism refers to the occurrence of two or more compounds with the same molecular formula but different properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Isomerism</h3>
    <ul>

                 <h1> Hydrocarbon Chemistry</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms only. They are classified as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The aliphatic hydrocarbons are further classified as saturated and unsaturated. Saturated hydrocarbons have all the carbon atoms <span class="equation">sp<sup>3</sup></span> hybridized, they are either acyclic or cyclic (cycloalkanes). Unsaturated hydrocarbons consist of <span class="equation">sp<sup>2</sup></span> hybridized carbon atoms (alkenes) and <span class="equation">sp</span> hybridized carbon atoms (alkynes).</p>
    <p>The chemistry of hydrocarbons addresses both physical and chemical properties, these help to better understand them and their usefulness to the environment.</p>

    <h2> Alkanes</h2>
    <p>The trivial name is paraffins. They have a general formula, <span class="equation">C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub></span>. The simplest straight-chain member is methane, which has the carbon atom <span class="equation">sp<sup>3</sup></span> hybridized with a bond angle of 109.4° or 109° 28'. The atoms in alkanes are tetrahedrally arranged with a C-C bond length of 1.53 Å. They are classified into branched and straight-chain alkanes. In branched alkanes, the carbon skeleton is occasionally interrupted by substituting a carbon-hydrogen bond (C-H) with a carbon-carbon bond (C-C). For example:</p>

    <pre>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> - CH - C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub> (2-Methylpentane)</pre>
    <pre>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub> - CH - C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub> - C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub> (2,4-Dimethylhexane)</pre>

    <p>Straight-chain alkanes consist of a chain of methylene groups (-CH<sub>2</sub>) terminated at both ends by hydrogens. They are also referred to as normal alkanes.</p>

    <pre>H - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - H (n-Propane)</pre>
    <pre>H - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - CH<sub>2</sub> - H (n-Butane)</pre>

    <h2> Homologous Series</h2>
    <p>Any family of compounds in which the members differ in composition from one another by CH<sub>2</sub> is known as a homologous series. Individual members are known as homologues. Compounds in the same homologous series have a general formula, general methods of preparation, and general properties. The alkanes are all members of the same homologous series.</p>

    <h3> Nomenclature of the Alkanes</h3>
    <b>Common Names</b>
    <p>Straight-chain compounds are designated as normal compounds and the word "normal" is usually abbreviated as "n-".</p>

    <pre>CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> (n-Propane)</pre>
    <pre>CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> (n-Butane)</pre>

    <p>For branched-chain alkanes, names are arbitrarily assigned to alkyl groups or compounds. For example:</p>

    <pre>CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH- (an iso group)</pre>
    <pre>CH<sub>3</sub>-CH-CH-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> (a new group)</pre>

    <b>Systematic Names</b>
    <p>Systematic nomenclature for organic compounds was devised in 1969 by the commission on the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Naming of complex alkanes is possible. The following set of rules are followed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The longest carbon chain possible is chosen and taken as the parent name (or base name).</li>
        <li>The longest carbon chain is numbered from one end to the other such that the carbon attached to the branching group (substituent) is assigned the lowest possible number.</li>
        <li>The name is derived by prefixing the name of the substituent to the parent name.</li>
        <li>If more than one of the same type of substituent is present, modifying prefixes are used: di-(2), tri-(3), tetra-(4), etc.</li>
        <li>Whenever different substituents are present, their names are given in alphabetical order. It is important to note that modifying prefixes (di, tri, etc.) are not considered when alphabetizing.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, a complex substituent is indicated by a parenthesis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre>2,4-Dimethylhexane</pre>
    <pre>3-Ethyl-5-methylheptane</pre>

    <h3> Physical Properties of Alkanes</h3>
    <p>Physical properties of organic compounds are largely dictated by the kind of intermolecular forces existing within the compounds. Van der Waals forces, which are weak, are the intermolecular forces responsible for alkanes' physical properties. Van der Waals forces become stronger with increasing chain length and decrease with increased branching.</p>
    <p>Due to the presence of weak Van der Waals forces, alkanes have lower boiling points, melting points, density, and viscosity than other classes of compounds with comparable molecular weights. The physical properties increase as the carbon chain increases and decrease with branching. Alkanes are either non-polar or weakly polar compounds. Normal alkanes from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> are colorless gases, C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>12</sub> are colorless liquids, and from C<sub>13</sub> onwards, they are colorless solids.</p>

    <h3> Sources of Alkanes</h3>
    <p>Alkanes are obtained both from natural sources and by preparation in laboratories.</p>
    <h1>Natural Source of Alkanes</h1>
    <p>Alkanes occur commonly in nature. The chief sources are petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Natural gas consists mainly of methane, ethane, and propane. Coal, pyrolysed under certain conditions, produces chiefly methane, ethane, and propane. Cracking (pyrolysis) of petroleum (crude oil) followed by distillation yields many hydrocarbon fractions.</p>

    <p class="formula">RMgX + HOH &rarr; R-H + Mg(OH)X</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>MgBr + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + Mg(OH)Br</p>

    <h3>3. Reduction of Alkyl Halides</h3>
    <p>Primary and secondary alkyl halides are readily reduced to alkanes by lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>). Secondary and tertiary alkyl halides are readily reduced to alkanes by sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) while triphenyltin hydride (Ph<sub>3</sub>SnH) reduces all three types of halides.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">Br-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + LiAlH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHBrCH<sub>3</sub> + NaBH<sub>4</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + Ph<sub>3</sub>SnH &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>

    <h3>4. Coupling of Alkyl Halides with Organometallic Compounds</h3>
    <p>Coupling takes place in the reaction between a lithium dialkyl copper (R<sub>2</sub>CuLi) and an alkyl halide (R'X).</p>
    <p class="formula">R<sub>2</sub>CuLi + R'X &rarr; R-R' + RCu + LiX</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CuLi + CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>

    <h3>5. Wurtz Synthesis</h3>
    <p>Alkyl halides (preferably the bromide or iodide) in the presence of sodium metal will dimerize to give alkanes. Silver and copper metals in a finely divided state may also be used.</p>
    <p class="formula">2R-X + 2Na &rarr; R-R + 2NaX</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">2CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br + 2Na &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + 2NaBr</p>

    <h2>Reactions of Alkanes</h2>
    <h3>1. Halogenation</h3>
    <p>Reaction of a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) with any compound is called halogenation reaction. Halogenation of alkanes involves homolytic cleavage. Under the influence of ultraviolet light, chlorine or bromine converts alkanes into chloroalkanes or bromoalkanes. Fluorine gives the same results when diluted with an inert gas. Iodination does not take place at all with methane. A mixture of all possible isomeric haloalkanes is obtained but all isomers are formed in unequal amounts, due to the difference in the reactivity of primary, secondary, and tertiary hydrogen atoms. Ease of substitution is tertiary hydrogen > secondary > primary.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>4</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> (hv) &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + HCl</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> (hv) &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl + CH<sub>3</sub>CHClCH<sub>3</sub></p>

    <h3>2. Combustion</h3>
    <p>Alkanes readily burn in excess of oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water. The process is referred to as combustion.</p>
    <p class="formula">C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub> + (3n+1)/2 O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; nCO<sub>2</sub> + (n+1)H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> + 13/2 O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 4CO<sub>2</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>However, insufficient oxygen will result in incomplete combustion.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; C + CO + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

    <h3>3. Nitration</h3>
    <p>This is the reaction of alkanes with trioxonitrate (V) acid. Nitration of the alkanes may be carried out in the vapor phase between 150&deg;C and 475&deg;C and a complex mixture of mononitroalkanes is obtained. The mixture consists of all the possible mononitroderivatives and the nitro compounds formed by every possibility of chain fission of the alkane.</p>

    <h3>4. Sulphonation</h3>
    <p>This is the reaction of the alkanes with tetraoxo sulphate (VI) acid in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by a sulphonic acid group. Sulphonation of a normal alkane from hexane onward may be carried out by reacting the alkane with oleum (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>).</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CH + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> &rarr; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CSO<sub>3</sub>H + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>

    <h3>5. Isomerization</h3>
    <p>Isomerization of the n-alkanes is made possible through the reaction of n-alkane with aluminum chloride at 300&deg;C.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> (AlCl<sub>3</sub>, 300&deg;C) &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>-CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)-CH<sub>3</sub></p>

    <h3>6. Pyrolysis (Cracking)</h3>
    <p>The thermal decomposition of a compound is known as pyrolysis. The pyrolysis of alkanes is known as cracking and yields a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. When alkanes are pyrolyzed, the carbon-carbon single bonds are broken homolytically to form alkyl radicals:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> &rarr; 2CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub></p>
    <p>These undergo further reactions:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>2</sub>=CHCH<sub>3</sub></p>

    <h2>Different Types of Cracking</h2>
    <h3>Thermal Cracking</h3>
    <p>This is when alkanes are heated to a high temperature. In this process, large alkanes are converted into smaller alkanes, alkenes (predominantly ethane), and hydrogen.</p>

    <h3>Steam Cracking</h3>
    <p>This is the process whereby hydrocarbons are diluted with steam and heated for a fraction of a second to 700-900&deg;C then rapidly cooled. Important chemicals like ethene, propene, butadiene, isoprene, and cyclopentadiene are the products of steam cracking.</p>

    <h3>Hydrocracking</h3>
    <p>This is carried out in the presence of a catalyst and hydrogen at high pressure and temperature range between 250-450&deg;C. Low molecular weight alkenes obtained are the most important raw materials for the large-scale synthesis of aliphatic compounds.</p>

    <h3>Catalytic Cracking</h3>
    <p>Higher boiling petroleum fractions are brought into contact with a finely divided silica-alumina catalyst at 450-550&deg;C and under slight pressure. Large molecules are broken down into smaller ones, thereby increasing the yield of gasoline (petrol). It yields alkanes and alkenes with highly branched structures desirable in gasoline, thereby improving the quality of the gasoline.</p>

    <h2>Knocking and Octane Number</h2>
    <p>Knocking is the term used or applied to the non-smooth combustion property of alkane used as fuels in internal combustion engines. Knocking is said to arise if a fuel burns in an engine and leaves a residual proportion that burns with difficulty. The engine cuts off making a metallic sound. When this happens, the engine is said to have knocked.</p>
    <p>The problem of knocking has been overcome by adding an antiknock additive known as tetraethyllead [Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] fuel. Also, hydrocarbons of high octane number are selected. Octane number is a percentage of iso-octane in the fuel. Octane number is based on an arbitrary knocking scale in which normal heptane that causes severe knocking is given the value of zero and iso-octane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) that causes little knocking is given the value of 100.</p>

    <h3>Arbitrary Knocking Scale</h3>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></p>
    <p>Fuels with high octane numbers are said to be good and preferred. Occurrence of sulphur in petrol affects the smooth combustion of the petrol in internal combustion engines. It also deactivates the tetraethyllead added as an antiknock, therefore, the sulphur content must be removed totally during the process of refining. The lower the sulphur content in the petroleum, the higher the quality of petrol.</p>

<h3>Physical Properties</h3>
<p>Alkenes are insoluble in water but quite soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene, ether, and chloroform. They are less dense than water and are weakly polar. Alkenes are also subject to weak van der Waals attractive forces, therefore have low boiling points and melting points which are very nearly the same as that of the alkane with the corresponding carbon skeleton.</p>

     <h3>Laboratory Preparation of Alkenes</h3>
    <b>Dehydration of Alcohols</b>
    <p>Alcohols lose a molecule of H<sub>2</sub>O when heated in the presence of a strong acid or by passing the alcohol vapor over alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) catalyst at high temperatures to give the corresponding alkenes. Concentrated tetraoxo (VI) acid is commonly used on primary alcohol at 160-170&deg;C, while dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols is best carried out using dilute tetraoxo sulphate (VI) acid.</p>
    <p>Ease of dehydration of alcohols is 3&deg; &gt; 2&deg; &gt; 1&deg;.</p>
    <p>Generally, the dehydration reaction can be represented as follows:</p>
    <p class="formula">C-C (Alcohol) &rarr; C=C (Alkene) + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

    <h3>Physical Properties of Alkynes</h3>
    <p>Alkynes are compounds of low polarity. They are insoluble in water but quite soluble in organic solvents such as ether, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, etc. They have low melting and boiling points which increase with increasing carbon number and decrease with chain branching. They have nearly the same boiling points as corresponding alkanes and alkenes.</p>
    <p>Ethyne burns with a luminous smoky flame due to its high carbon content, hence it is used for lighting purposes. It is also used in oxyacetylene flame and for the preparation of a large number of compounds such as ethane and ethanoic acid.</p>

    <h3>Industrial Source of Alkynes</h3>
    <p>Ethyne, being the most important of the alkynes, is prepared by the action of water on calcium carbide according to the reaction scheme below:</p>
    <p class="formula">CaC<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O → C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub></p>
    <p>Alternatively, it is obtained from petroleum through the controlled, high-temperature partial oxidation of methane. Methane is a constituent of natural gas, a thermally immature petroleum.</p>
    <p class="formula">2CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 2CO + 2H<sub>2</sub></p>

    <h3>General Methods of Preparation of Alkynes</h3>
    <b>1. Dehydrohalogenation of Alkyl Dihalides</b>
    <p>Conversion of alkyl halides occurs via two stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Formation of a vinylic halide through the action of alcoholic potassium hydroxide on alkyl dihalides.</li>
        <li>Vinylic halides under more vigorous conditions are converted to alkynes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHBr<sub>2</sub> + KOH (alc.) → CH<sub>3</sub>CH=CHBr → CH<sub>3</sub>C≡CH</p>

    <b>2. Reaction of Metal Acetylides with Primary Alkyl Halides</b>
    <p>Metal acetylides such as lithium or sodium acetylides can react with primary alkyl halides to yield alkynes. Conversion of smaller alkynes into larger ones is made possible by this method.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <p class="formula">H-C≡C-Li + CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Br → H-C≡C-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> (1-hexyne)</p>
    <p class="formula">H-C≡C-Na + CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Br → H-C≡C-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> (1-butyne)</p>

    <h3>Reactions of Alkynes</h3>
    <b>1. Catalytic Hydrogenation</b>
    <p>Alkynes add hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to yield alkanes:</p>
    <p class="formula">R-C≡C-R + 2H<sub>2</sub>/Pt → R-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-R</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="formula">CH<sub>3</sub>-C≡C-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> (n-pentane)</p>
    <p>Partial reduction of alkyne to alkene is also possible. Trans-alkene is obtained by reduction of alkynes with sodium or lithium in liquid ammonia, and cis-alkene is obtained by hydrogenation of alkynes with Lindlar catalyst (Pd/BaSO<sub>4</sub>/quinoline).</p>
    
    <b>2. Addition of Halogens</b>
    <p>Acetylene adds gaseous chlorine or bromine in the dark. The reaction is catalyzed by light and metallic halides.</p>
    <p class="formula">HC≡CH + Br<sub>2</sub> → BrCH=CHBr → Br<sub>2</sub>C-CBr<sub>2</sub> (1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane)</p>
    
    <b>3. Addition of Hydrogen Halides</b>
    <p>Alkynes react with hydrogen halides in the dark. The reaction is catalyzed by light or metallic halides, following Markovnikov's rule.</p>
    
    <b>4. Hydration</b>
    <p>Alkynes can be hydrated in the presence of acid and mercury (II) sulfate (HgSO<sub>4</sub>) as a catalyst, where a molecule of water is added across the triple bond. The reaction involves electrophilic addition and follows Markovnikov's rule.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The functional group is an atom or a group of atoms responsible for the chemical behaviour of a compound. For example, alkanols behave chemically differently from amines because the functional groups in them are different.</p>
        <p>Compounds having the same functional group and hence behave chemically in a similar manner are grouped together to form what is called the homologous series. Some important functional groups and the classes of compounds to which they give rise are shown below:</p>

        <h2> Alkanols (Alcohols)</h2>
        <p>Alcohols are compounds containing one or more hydroxyl groups. i.e., alcohols are hydroxyl derivatives of the alkanes.</p>

        <h2> Classification</h2>
        <p>Alcohols are classified according to the number of hydroxyl groups in a molecule of the alcohol:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Monohydric alcohols:</b> This class of the alcohols contains only one hydroxyl group in a molecule of the alcohol. Examples include Methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and Ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH).</li>
            <li><b>Dihydric alcohols:</b> This class contains two hydroxyl groups per molecule of the alcohol. An example of dihydric alcohol is ethane-1,2-diol (CH<sub>2</sub>OHCH<sub>2</sub>OH).</li>
            <li><b>Trihydric alcohols:</b> As the name implies, they contain three hydroxyl groups per molecule. An example is propane-1,2,3-triol or glycerol (CH<sub>2</sub>OHCHOHCH<sub>2</sub>OH).</li>
            <li><b>Polyhydric alcohols:</b> These class have many hydroxyl groups per molecule.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Monohydric Alcohols</h2>
        <p>The saturated monohydric alcohols have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>O or more satisfactorily C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>OH or ROH to show that the functional group is the hydroxyl (OH) group.</p>

        <h2> Classes of Monohydric Alcohols</h2>
        <p>There are three classes of monohydric alcohols based on the position of the hydroxyl group in the molecule:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Primary alcohols (1°):</b> In primary alcohols, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group carries not more than one alkyl group, i.e., the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group carries at least two hydrogen atoms (RCH<sub>2</sub>OH). Examples include Methanol and Ethanol.</li>
            <li><b>Secondary alcohols (2°):</b> In secondary alcohols, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group also carries two alkyl groups, i.e., the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group carries only one hydrogen atom (RRCHOH). An example is Propane-2-ol.</li>
            <li><b>Tertiary alcohols (3°):</b> In tertiary alcohols, the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group also carries three alkyl groups, i.e., the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group bears no hydrogen atom (R<sub>3</sub>COH). An example is 2-Methylpropan-2-ol.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Nomenclature</h2>
        <p>There are two methods of naming the monohydric alcohols:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>By the trivial or common name:</b> In this method, the alcohols are named as derivatives of the alkyl group attached to the hydroxyl group. The word alcohol follows the name of the alkyl group to which the hydroxyl group is attached. Examples include Methyl alcohol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), Ethyl alcohol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH), n-propyl alcohol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH), isopropyl alcohol (CH<sub>3</sub>CHOHCH<sub>3</sub>), and 1-butyl alcohol ((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>COH).</li>
            <li><b>By the IUPAC system:</b> The following steps are taken to name the alcohols by the IUPAC system:
                <ol>
                    <li>The longest continuous carbon chain containing the hydroxyl group is chosen as the parent alkane.</li>
                    <li>Replace the final <i>-e</i> of the parent alkane name with <i>-ol</i> to give the parent alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Indicate the position of the hydroxyl group on the parent chain with the lowest possible number.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Methanol for CH<sub>3</sub>OH</li>
                    <li>Ethanol for CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH</li>
                    <li>Propan-1-ol for CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH</li>
                    <li>Propan-2-ol for CH<sub>3</sub>CHOHCH<sub>3</sub></li>
                    <li>Butan-1-ol for CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH</li>
                    <li>Butan-2-ol for CH<sub>3</sub>CHOHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></li>
                    <li>2-Methylpropan-2-ol for (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>COH</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Preparation of Alkanols</h2>
        <p>The general methods of preparing the monohydric alkanols include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Hydration of alkenes:</b> Alkanols can be prepared by the addition of water to alkenes in the presence of a catalyst such as phosphoric acid.</li>
            <li><b>Reduction of carbonyl compounds:</b> Alkanols can be synthesized by reducing aldehydes and ketones using reducing agents such as sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride.</li>
            <li><b>Hydrolysis of alkyl halides:</b> Alkanols can be produced by the nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides with aqueous sodium hydroxide.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Properties of Alkanols</h2>
        <p>Alcohols exhibit both physical and chemical properties. Some of the important properties are:</p>

        <h3> Physical Properties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Alcohols are generally colorless liquids with a characteristic odor.</li>
            <li>They have higher boiling points than hydrocarbons of similar molecular weight due to hydrogen bonding.</li>
            <li>Lower alkanols (up to four carbon atoms) are soluble in water due to hydrogen bonding with water molecules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Chemical Properties</h3>
        <p>Alcohols undergo a variety of chemical reactions, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Dehydration:</b> Alcohols can be dehydrated to form alkenes in the presence of acid catalysts such as sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid.</li>
            <li><b>Oxidation:</b> Primary alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes and further to carboxylic acids, while secondary alcohols can be oxidized to ketones. Tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation.</li>
            <li><b>Esterification:</b> Alcohols react with carboxylic acids in the presence of acid catalysts to form esters and water.</li>
        </ol>

         <h1>Effect of Ring Substituent on Acid Strength of Phenols</h1>

        <p>(i) The methyl group decreases the acid strength of phenol from all ring positions. The reason is, the methyl group has +I effect and therefore opposes the delocalisation of the lone pair from oxygen of the OH into the ring. This leads to less number of resonance structures compared to phenol.</p>

        <p>(ii) The nitro-group can enter into resonance (-R) with the hydroxyl group from both the o- and p-positions. This leads to an increased number of resonance structures. Therefore, o- and p-nitrophenols are stronger acids than phenol.</p>

        

        

        <p>(iii) When the nitro-group is at the m-position, it cannot enter into resonance with the hydroxyl group, but it can exert a -I effect. Therefore, m-nitrophenol is a stronger acid than phenol, but it is not as strong as the o- and p-isomers.</p>

        

        <p>(iv) Groups with a +R effect (e.g., NH<sub>2</sub>, MeO) weaken the acid strength of the phenol when in the p-position but strengthen it when in the m-position. The halogenophenols are stronger acids than phenol because the -I effect of a halogen atom is greater than its +R effect.</p>

        <p>(v) When intramolecular hydrogen bonding is possible, the unionized form of the phenol is stabilized and hence the acid strength of the phenol is weakened.</p>

        <h2>Reactions of Phenols</h2>

        <p>(1) Like alcohols, phenols react with acid chlorides to form esters:</p>

        >

        <p>(2) The other reactions of phenols are electrophilic substitution reactions typical of aromatic compounds.</p>

                carbonyl: `
                <h1> Carbonyl Compounds</h1>
        <p>Carbonyl compounds contain the carbonyl (RCHO) group as the functional group. The carbonyl group is the functional group in aldehydes and ketones and is part of the functional group of carboxylic acids and their derivatives e.g. esters, amides, acid halides, and acid anhydrides. The only functional group in both aldehydes and ketones is the carbonyl group; therefore, the two are referred to as carbonyl compounds. Aldehydes and ketones are also referred to as Alkanals and Alkanones respectively. In aldehydes, one of the available valencies of the carbonyl group is attached to hydrogen and the other to an alkyl group giving the structure RCHO. Therefore, in aldehydes, the carbonyl group is terminal. In ketones, the two available valencies are attached to alkyl groups giving the structure RCOR; hence, the carbonyl group is within the chain in ketones.</p>

        

        <h2>Nomenclature (IUPAC)</h2>
        <h3>Aldehydes (Alkanals)</h3>
        <p>They are named by adding the suffix <em>al</em> to the name of the hydrocarbon from which they are derived. The longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde group is the parent hydrocarbon, and the chain is numbered starting with the aldehyde carbon.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO - Butanal</p>
            <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CHO - Ethanal</p>
            <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CHO - 2-Ethylbutanal</p>
            <p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO - Benzaldehyde</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Ketones (Alkanones)</h3>
        <p>The class suffix for ketones is <em>one</em>. The suffix is added to the name of the hydrocarbon from which they are derived. The longest carbon chain containing the keto group is chosen as the parent hydrocarbon. The chain is numbered starting from the end closer to the carbonyl carbon.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <p>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub> - Pentan-2-one</p>

        </div>

        <h2> Physical Properties</h2>
        <p>Aldehydes and ketones are polar because the carbonyl group is polar. Therefore, their boiling points are higher than those of non-polar compounds of comparable molecular weights. However, their boiling points are lower than the boiling points of the corresponding alcohols or carboxylic acids because of their inability to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Carbonyl compounds can form hydrogen bonds with water; hence, they are soluble or partially soluble in water. Methanal is a gas at room temperature, while other aldehydes and ketones with relatively low molecular weights are liquids, and the rest are solids.</p>

        <h2> Methods of Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Aldehydes are obtained by oxidation (or dehydrogenation) of primary alcohols, while ketones are obtained by oxidation (or dehydrogenation) of secondary alcohols.</li>

                <h2>CARBOXYLIC ACIDS (ALKANOIC ACIDS) AND ALKANOATES (ESTERS)</h2>

<p>Carboxylic acids are organic compounds with a carboxyl group (-COOH) as the functional group. They are classified based on the number of carboxyl groups per molecule as monocarboxylic acids (one carboxyl group), dicarboxylic acids (two carboxyl groups), etc.</p>

<h3>20.1 Monocarboxylic Acids</h3>

<p>The saturated monocarboxylic acids have the general formula CH<sub>3</sub>COOH or RCOOH. They are also referred to as the fatty acids because some of the higher members, e.g., palmitic and stearic acids, occur in natural fats.</p>

<h3>20.2 Nomenclature</h3>

<p><strong>(i) Common or Trivial Names</strong></p>
<p>Some monocarboxylic acids are known by their trivial names, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HCOOH - Formic acid</li>
    <li>CH<sub>3</sub>COOH - Acetic acid</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(ii) IUPAC System</strong></p>
<p>In the IUPAC system, the class suffix for monocarboxylic acids is "oic." Their names are obtained from the corresponding alkanes by replacing the final "e" of the alkane with "oic acid." Positions of substituents are indicated by numbering the longest carbon chain starting with the carboxyl carbon:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> - Ethane</li>
    <li>CH<sub>3</sub>COOH - Ethanoic acid</li>
    <li>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> - Propane</li>
    <li>CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH - Propanoic acid</li>
    <li>CH<sub>3</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>COOH - 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid</li>
</ul>

<h3>20.3 Some Methods of Preparation of Acids</h3>

<p><strong>1. By oxidation of alcohols, aldehydes, or ketones with acid dichromate</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCH<sub>2</sub>OH → RCHO → RCOOH</p>
<p class="equation">R<sub>2</sub>CHOH → R<sub>2</sub>CO → RCOOH + RCOOH</p>

<p><strong>2. By acid or alkali hydrolysis of acid nitriles and acid amides</strong></p>
<p class="equation">R-CN + H<sub>2</sub>O → R-CONH<sub>2</sub></p>
<p class="equation">R-CONH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → RCOOH + NH<sub>3</sub></p>

<p><strong>3. By the reaction of carbon dioxide with a Grignard reagent followed by hydrolysis</strong></p>
<p class="equation">R-MgX + CO<sub>2</sub> → R-CO-OMgX → RCOOH + Mg(OH)X</p>

<h3>20.4 Physical Properties</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The lower members are liquids with pungent smells, while the higher members are solids at room temperature.</li>
    <li>The lower members are soluble in water, but as the molecular weight increases, solubility decreases. Solubility of the acids in water is facilitated by the ability of the acids to form hydrogen bonds with water.</li>
    <li>The boiling points of carboxylic acids are much higher than those of the alkanes of similar molecular weight. This is because of the presence of hydrogen bonds between the acid molecules. Pairs of acid molecules are linked by two hydrogen bonds to form a dimer.</li>
    <li>The melting points of straight-chain monocarboxylic acids show alternation from one member to the next. The melting point of an even acid is higher than that of the odd acid immediately below and above it in the series.</li>
</ul>

<h3>20.5 Chemical Reactions</h3>

<p><strong>1. Carboxylic acids are weak acids; they dissociate only to a small extent in water</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH ↔ RCOO<sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>They are stronger acids than phenols but weaker than sulphonic acids. Acid strength of the carboxylic acids decreases as the homologous series is ascended because the electron-releasing ability (+I effect) of the alkyl group hinders the ionization of the acids. The longer the alkyl chain, the stronger the +I effect and hence the weaker the acid.</p>

<p><strong>2. They react with strongly electropositive metals to liberate hydrogen</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + Na → RCOONa + 1/2 H<sub>2</sub></p>

<p><strong>3. They react with bases to form salts</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + NaOH → RCOONa + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

<p>They react with carbonates and hydrogen carbonates to liberate carbon (IV) oxide.</p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> → RCOONa + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p><strong>4. Carboxylic acids react with alcohols in the presence of a mineral acid catalyst (e.g., conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) to form esters</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + R'OH → RCOOR' + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

<p><strong>5. They react with phosphorus halides to form acid halides</strong></p>
<p class="equation">3RCOOH + PCl<sub>3</sub> → 3RCOCl + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + PCl<sub>5</sub> → RCOCl + POCl<sub>3</sub> + HCl</p>
<p>Thionyl chloride can also be used:</p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + SOCl<sub>2</sub> → RCOCl + SO<sub>2</sub> + HCl</p>

<p><strong>6. In the presence of light (UV), they react with halogens to give halogen-substituted acids</strong></p>
<p class="equation">CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>2</sub>ClCOOH + HCl</p>
<p class="equation">CH<sub>2</sub>ClCOOH + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CHCl<sub>2</sub>COOH + HCl</p>
<p class="equation">CHCl<sub>2</sub>COOH + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CCl<sub>3</sub>COOH + HCl</p>
<p>The α-halogen acids are stronger than the acids from which they are formed because of the electron-withdrawing ability (-I effects) of the halogen atoms. The more the number of halogen atoms on the α-carbon, the stronger the acid.</p>
<p>Halogen acids in which the halogen atom is further from the α-carbon are weaker than the α-halogen acids but stronger than the corresponding normal acids. The influence of the -I effects of the halogens decreases with increased distance from the carboxyl group.</p>

<p><strong>7. The reduction products of monocarboxylic acids depend on the reducing agent</strong></p>
<p>They are reduced to primary alcohols by the tetrahydridoaluminate (III) (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>). Various metallic hydrides such as lithium aluminum hydride can be used:</p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH → RCH<sub>2</sub>OH</p>

<p><strong>8. All the acids, except formic acid, are extremely resistant to oxidation</strong></p>
<p>However, on prolonged heating with oxidizing agents, carbon dioxide and water are formed.</p>

<h3>20.6 ALKANOATES (ESTERS)</h3>

<p>Alkanoates (Esters) are derivatives of carboxylic acids in which the hydrogen of the carboxyl group of the acid has been replaced by an alkyl group. They have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>O or RCOOR' and the structure is:</p>
<p class="equation">RCOOR'</p>
<p>Where R and R' are alkyl groups.</p>

<h3>20.6.1 Methods of Preparation</h3>

<p><strong>1. By the reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in the presence of a small amount of an inorganic acid (e.g., concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) as a catalyst</strong></p>
<p>This reaction is reversible. The forward process is known as esterification while the backward process is known as hydrolysis:</p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + R'OH ↔ RCOOR' + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>The yield of the ester may be increased by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using excess acid or alcohol</li>
    <li>Removing the water or ester from the reaction mixture as soon as it is formed by distillation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. By reaction between an alcohol and acid chloride or acid anhydride</strong></p>
<p class="equation">ROH + RCOCl → RCOOR' + HCl</p>
<p class="equation">(RCO)<sub>2</sub>O + R'OH → RCOOR' + RCOOH</p>

<p><strong>3. By refluxing the silver salt of an acid with an alkyl halide in ethanolic solution</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOAg + R'Br → RCOOR' + AgBr</p>

<p><strong>4. Methyl esters are prepared by the reaction between an organic acid and solution of diazomethane in ether</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOH + CH<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> → RCOOCH<sub>3</sub> + N<sub>2</sub></p>

<h3>20.6.2 Physical Properties</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Esters of organic acids are neutral liquids or solids with pleasant smells. They are responsible for the pleasant smell of odoriferous plants.</li>
    <li>The melting and boiling points of esters are lower than those of the corresponding acids because ester molecules are not associated by hydrogen bonds. As expected, the boiling points of esters increase as the molecular weight increases, and for isomeric esters, the melting point decreases with increased branching.</li>
    <li>The low molecular weight esters are soluble in water because hydrogen bonding is possible between ester and water molecules. Solubility in water decreases as the molecular weight increases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>20.6.3 Nomenclature (IUPAC)</h3>

<p>Esters are named as the alkyl salts of the organic acid. The group RCOO is known as the alkanoate. The name of the alkyl group from the alcohol is followed by the name of the alkanoate:</p>
<p class="equation">CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>OH → CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>In this case, "CH<sub>3</sub> (Methyl)" is from the alcohol and "CH<sub>3</sub>COO (Ethanoate)" is from the acid, so the name of the ester is Methylethanoate.</p>

<h3>20.6.4 Chemical Reactions</h3>

<p><strong>1. Esters are hydrolyzed by heating with mineral acids or alkalis</strong></p>
<p>Hydrolysis with acid gives the carboxylic acid and the alcohol:</p>
<p class="equation">CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>OH</p>
<p>Alkaline hydrolysis of esters gives salt of the acid and the alcohol:</p>
<p class="equation">CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub> + NaOH → CH<sub>3</sub>COONa + CH<sub>3</sub>OH</p>
<p>Alkali salts of the higher acids are known as soaps and alkaline hydrolysis of esters is known as saponification.</p>

<p><strong>2. Esters are reduced by reducing agents such as sodium in ethanol or butanol, the metallic hydrides (except NaBH<sub>4</sub>) or by catalytic hydrogenation to give the alcohols</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOR' → RCH<sub>2</sub>OH + R'OH</p>

<p><strong>3. Esters react with ammonia to form amides</strong></p>
<p class="equation">RCOOR' + NH<sub>3</sub> → RCONH<sub>2</sub> + R'OH</p>
<p>This reaction is an example of ammonolysis (splitting by ammonia).</p>

<p><strong>4. The alcohol residue in an ester can be replaced by another alcohol residue by refluxing the ester with excess of the alcohol in the presence of a small amount of acid or sodium alkoxide as catalyst</strong></p>
<p class="equation">CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH → NaOEt → CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>OH</p>
<p>This reaction is known as transesterification or alcoholysis. It is usually effective in replacing a higher alcohol by a lower one.</p>

<p><strong>5. The acid residue in an ester can also be replaced by another acid residue</strong></p>
<p class="equation">CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>COOH → CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> + C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>COOH</p>
<p>This reaction is known as acidolysis.</p>

                    <h2>General Characteristics of Waves</h2>
<b>Definition:</b>
<p>A wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium, transferring energy from one point to another without causing permanent displacement of the medium.</p>

<b>Key Terms:</b>

<p><b>Amplitude (A):</b> The maximum displacement of particles from their mean position, measured in meters.<br>
<b>Wavelength (λ):</b> The distance between two successive crests or troughs of a wave, also measured in meters.<br>
<b>Period (T):</b> The time taken for one complete cycle or oscillation, measured in seconds.<br>
<B>Frequency (f):</b> The number of cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz).</p>
The relationship between period and frequency is <b>𝑇=<sup>1</sup>/<sub>𝑓</sub> .</b>
<p><b>Wave Speed (V):</b> The speed at which the wave travels, calculated as</p> 𝑉=𝜆×𝑓.</p>

<b>Example Problems</b><br><br>

    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>Wave speed <b>V</b> = distance / time = 20 m / 1 s = 20 m/s</p>

    <h2>Reflection of Light at Plane Surfaces</h2>
    <p>The incident ray ON that emerges along PQ has been deviated twice; through angles <i>d<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>2</sub></i>. Therefore, the emergent ray will be deviated through <i>d<sub>1</sub> + d<sub>2</sub> = D</i>. Remember, angle of deviation, <i>d = 180 - 2i</i> or <i>180 - 2r</i>.</p>
    
    <h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> An object is placed 10cm in front of a plane mirror. If it is moved 8cm farther away from the mirror, determine the distance of the final image from the mirror. </p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>When an object is placed in front of a plane mirror, the size of the image formed is the same size as the object. Also, the distance (<i>u</i>) of the object from the mirror is always equal to the distance (<i>v</i>) of the image from the mirror. That is <i>u = v</i>.</p>
    <p>Object distance from mirror, <i>u = 10 + 8 = 18cm</i></p>
    <p>Therefore, image distance <i>v = 18cm</i></p>
    
    <h3>Example 3</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A man stands 4m in front of a plane mirror. If the mirror is moved 1m towards the man, the distance between him and his new image is:</p>
    <p>A. 3m</p>
    <p>B. 5m</p>
    <p>C. 6m</p>
    <p>D. 10m</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>When the mirror is moved 1m towards the man, the object distance becomes <i>4 - 1 = 3m</i>. The image distance from the mirror is also 3m. Therefore, distance between the man and his image is <i>3 + 3 = 6m</i>.</p>

    <h2>Images Formed by Inclined Mirrors</h2>
    <p>When two mirrors are inclined at an angle <i>θ</i> to each other, the number (<i>n</i>) of images formed is given by:</p>

    <p>The angle that the new reflected ray makes with the normal before rotation is:</p>
    <p class="equ### Reflection of Light Waves

Formation of images by a pinhole camera, plane, and spherical mirrors depends on the fact that light travels in a straight line and can be reflected by plane surfaces and mirrors.

### The Pinhole Camera: Magnification

The magnification (\(M\)) of a pinhole camera is given by:

\[ M = \frac{\text{image height}}{\text{object height}} = \frac{\text{image distance from pinhole}}{\text{object distance from pinhole}} \]

Any combination of the above formulas can be used when solving problems involving a pinhole camera.

#### Example 1

A boy 1.5m tall stands 2.0m in front of a pinhole camera of length 20.0cm. Calculate the height of his image.

**Solution:**
- Object height = 1.5m
- Object distance from pinhole = 2.0m
- Camera length = 20cm = 0.2m
- Height of image = ?

Using the formula for magnification:
\[ \text{image height} = \text{camera length} \times \frac{\text{object height}}{\text{object distance from pinhole}} \]
\[ \text{image height} = 0.2m \times \frac{1.5m}{2.0m} = 0.15m \text{ or } 15cm \]

### Reflection of Light at Plane Surfaces

The incident ray ON that emerges along PQ has been deviated twice, through angles \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) as shown. Therefore, the emergent ray will be deviated through \( d_1 + d_2 = D \). Remember, the angle of deviation \( d = 180^\circ - 2i \) or \( 180^\circ - 2r \).

#### Example 6

An object is placed 10cm in front of a plane mirror. If it is moved 8cm farther away from the mirror, determine the distance of the final image from the mirror.

**Solution:**
When an object is placed in front of a plane mirror, the size of the image formed is the same size as the object. Also, the distance (\(u\)) of the object from the mirror is always equal to the distance (\(v\)) of the image from the mirror. That is \(u = v\).

- Initial object distance from mirror, \(u = 10\) cm
- Moved object distance from mirror, \(u = 10 + 8 = 18\) cm
- Therefore, image distance \(v = 18\) cm

### Images Formed by Inclined Mirrors

When two mirrors are inclined at an angle (\(\theta\)) to each other, the number (\(n\)) of images formed is given by:

\[ n = \frac{360^\circ}{\theta} - 1 \]

#### Example 8

A candle is placed between two mirrors which are inclined at an angle of 72° and facing each other. How many images will be observed in the two mirrors?

**Solution:**
- Angle of inclination, \(\theta = 72^\circ\)
- Number of images, \(n = \frac{360^\circ}{72^\circ} - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4\)

### Rotation of Plane Mirrors

When a ray of light is incident on a plane mirror and the mirror is rotated through an angle \(\theta\) while keeping the incident ray constant, the reflected ray will be rotated through \(2\theta\).

#### Example 18

A ray of light strikes a plane mirror at an angle of incidence of 35°. If the mirror is rotated through 10°, through what angle is the reflected ray rotated?

**Solution:**
- Angle of rotation of the mirror, \(\theta = 10^\circ\)
- Angle of rotation of the reflected ray = \(2\theta = 2 \times 10^\circ = 20^\circ\)

### Spherical Mirrors: Concave and Convex

#### Important Formulas:
1. **Focal length:** \( f = \frac{R}{2} \)
2. **Mirror equation:** \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \)
3. **Magnification:** \( M = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{\text{image height}}{\text{object height}} \)

### Examples

#### Example 15

An object is placed in front of a concave mirror whose radius of curvature is 12cm. If the magnification of the image produced is 1.5, how far is the object from the mirror?

**Solution:**
- Magnification \(M = 1.5\)
- Radius of curvature \(R = 12\) cm
- Focal length \(f = \frac{R}{2} = 6\) cm

Using \(M = \frac{v}{u}\):
\[ 1.5 = \frac{v}{u} \]
\[ v = 1.5u \]

Substitute into the mirror equation:
\[ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \]
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{1.5u} \]
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1 + \frac{2}{3}}{u} \]
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{\frac{5}{3}}{u} \]
\[ u = \frac{5}{3} \times 6 = 10 \text{ cm} \]

#### Example 17

An object is placed 10cm in front of a concave mirror of focal length 15cm. What is the position and nature of the image formed?

**Solution:**
- Object distance, \(u = 10\) cm
- Focal length, \(f = 15\) cm

Using the mirror equation:
\[ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \]
\[ \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{v} \]
\[ \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{10} \]
\[ \frac{1}{v} = \frac{2 - 3}{30} \]
\[ v = -30 \text{ cm} \]

If the image distance of a concave mirror is negative, it means that the image is virtual.

    <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> A ray of light is inclined at an angle of 30° on one top surface of a parallel-sided glass of refractive index 1.5. The ray finally emerges from the low surface. What is the angular deviation of the emerged ray?
    </p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>
        The incident and emergent rays are parallel in a rectangular glass block. Therefore, the angular deviation is 0°.
    </p>

    <h3>Critical Angle and Refractive Index</h3>
    <p>
        The critical angle is defined as the angle of incidence when the angle of refraction is 90°, as light passes from a denser to a less dense medium. For angles above the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs.

                    <h1>SOUND WAVES</h1>

<h3>VELOCITY AND REFLECTION OF SOUND WAVES</h3>

<p>Sound wave is a longitudinal wave and also a form of energy produced by vibrating bodies.</p>

<p>As common with waves, the velocity or speed of sound wave in any media is given by:</p>
<p class="equation">v = λf</p>
<p class="equation">v = λ/T</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>v = velocity of sound wave (m·s<sup>-1</sup>)</li>
    <li>λ = wavelength of sound wave (m)</li>
    <li>f = frequency of sound wave (Hz)</li>
    <li>T = period of sound wave (s)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the speed of sound (V) in air is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, θ:</p>
<p class="equation">V = √θ</p>

<p>A quick review of Chapter Twelve with emphasis on stationary waves will be helpful and relevant to this Chapter.</p>
<b>Example 1</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A source of sound produces waves in air of wavelength 1.65 m. If the speed of sound is 330 m·s<sup>-1</sup>, what is the period of vibration in seconds?</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Wavelength λ = 1.65 m</p>
<p>Speed of sound V = 330 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Substitute into V = λ/T to obtain:</p>
<p class="equation">330 = 1.65/T</p>
<p>Period of vibration T = 1.65/330 = 0.005 s</p>

<b>Example 2</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> In a sound wave in air, the adjacent rarefactions and compressions are separated by a distance of 17 cm. If the velocity of the sound wave is 340 m·s<sup>-1</sup>, determine the frequency.</p>
<p>A. 10 Hz</p>
<p>B. 20 Hz</p>
<p>C. 100 Hz</p>
<p>D. 5780 Hz</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Distance between successive rarefaction and compression is equivalent to λ/2:</p>
<p>λ/2 = 17 cm or λ = 2 × 17 cm = 34 cm = 0.34 m</p>
<p>From V = λf:</p>
<p>Velocity, V = 340 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Frequency, f = V/λ = 340/0.34 = 1000 Hz</p>

<b>Example 3</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A sound wave of velocity 350 m·s<sup>-1</sup> is directed towards the surface of water. If the ratio of the wavelength of sound in water to that in air is 425:100, calculate the velocity of the wave in water.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Sound wave velocity in air V<sub>1</sub> = 350 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Wavelength of sound in water λ<sub>2</sub> = 425</p>
<p>Wavelength of sound in air λ<sub>1</sub> = 100</p>
<p>From V = λf, we derive:</p>
<p class="equation">V<sub>1</sub>/λ<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub>/λ<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>Substitute into the equation:</p>
<p class="equation">350/100 = V<sub>2</sub>/425</p>
<p>Sound wave velocity in water, V<sub>2</sub> = (350 × 425)/100 = 1487.5 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>

<b>Example 4</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The velocity of sound wave at 27°C is 360 m·s<sup>-1</sup>. What is its velocity at 127°C?</p>
<p>A. 120√3 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>B. 240 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>C. 240√3 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>D. 720√3 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Temperature (θ) and speed of sound in air are related by V ∝ √θ:</p>
<p class="equation">V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>2</sub> = √(θ<sub>1</sub>/θ<sub>2</sub>)</p>
<p>θ<sub>1</sub> = 27 + 273 = 300 K</p>
<p>θ<sub>2</sub> = 127 + 273 = 400 K</p>
<p>V<sub>1</sub> = 360 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Substitute into the equation:</p>
<p class="equation">360/V<sub>2</sub> = √(300/400)</p>
<p class="equation">360/V<sub>2</sub> = √(3/4)</p>
<p>V<sub>2</sub> = (360√4)/√3 = (2 × 360)/√3 = 720/√3</p>
<p>Multiply both numerator and denominator by √3:</p>
<p class="equation">V<sub>2</sub> = (720√3)/(√3 × √3) = (720√3)/√9</p>
<p>Velocity of sound wave at 127°C, V<sub>2</sub> = (720√3)/3 = 240√3 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>

<b>Example 5</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The speed of sound in air is 330 m·s<sup>-1</sup>. How far from the center of a storm is an observer who hears a thunder clap 2 s after the lightning flash? [Neglect the time taken by light to travel to the observer]</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Speed of sound V = 330 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>From, speed (V) = distance (x)/time (t)</p>
<p>Time taken t = 2 s</p>
<p>Distance x = Vt = 330 × 2 = 660 m</p>
<p>Distance of storm's center x = 660 m</p>

<b>Echoes</b>
<p>Sound waves can be reflected. An echo is the sound heard after reflection from a surface such as a wall, cliff, sea bed, hill, etc. The distance between the source of sound and the reflecting surface is given by:</p>
<p class="equation">x = Vt/2</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>x = distance between the source of sound and the reflecting surface</li>
    <li>V = velocity of sound in the medium (air, water, glass, metal, etc.)</li>
    <li>t = time taken for the echo to return</li>
</ul>

<b>Example 6</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A bat emits a sound wave at a speed of 1650 m·s<sup>-1</sup> and receives the echo 0.15 s later. Calculate the distance of the bat from the reflector.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Speed of sound wave V = 1650 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Echo time t = 0.15 s</p>
<p>Substitute into x = (Vt)/2 to have:</p>
<p class="equation">x = (1650 × 0.15)/2 = 123.75 m</p>

<b>Example 7</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A fathometer is used to send a wave down to the sea bed. The reflected wave is received after 0.5 seconds. Calculate the depth of the sea. [Speed of sound in water = 1500 m·s<sup>-1</sup>]</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Echo time t = 0.5</p>
<p>Depth of sea, speed of sound V = 1500 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Substitute into x = (Vt)/2 to obtain:</p>
<p class="equation">x = (1500 × 0.5)/2 = 375 m</p>

<b>Example 8</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A sound pulse sent vertically downwards into the earth is reflected from two different layers of the earth such that echoes are heard after 1.2 s and 1.45 s. Assuming the speed of the pulse is 2000 m·s<sup>-1</sup>, calculate the distance between layers.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Distance of first layer x<sub>1</sub></p>
<p>First layer echo time t<sub>1</sub> = 1.2 s</p>
<p>Distance of second layer x<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>Second layer echo time t<sub>2</sub> = 1.4 s</p>
<p>Velocity of sound pulse V = 2000 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>From t = (2x)/V, the distance between layers is:</p>
<p class="equation">x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> = (V(t<sub>2</sub> - t<sub>1</sub>))/2</p>
<p class="equation">x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> = (2000(1.4 - 1.2))/2 = 1000 × 0.2 = 200 m</p>

<b>Example 9</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> As a ship approaches a cliff, its siren is sounded and the echo is heard in the ship after 12 seconds. 2.1 minutes later the siren is sounded again and the echo is heard 8 seconds later. If the speed of sound in air is 340 m·s<sup>-1</sup>, calculate the velocity at which the ship is approaching the cliff.</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>First echo time t<sub>1</sub> = 12 s</p>
<p>Sound speed V = 340 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Ship distance at 1<sup>st</sup> echo</p>
<p>Ship distance at 2<sup>nd</sup> echo</p>
<p>Second echo time t<sub>2</sub> = 8 s</p>
<p>Time interval between echoes T = 2.1 min = 2.1 × 60 = 126 s</p>
<p>Substitute into x = (Vt)/2 to obtain:</p>
<p class="equation">x<sub>1</sub> = (V × t<sub>1</sub>)/2 = (340 × 12)/2 = 2040 m</p>
<p class="equation">x<sub>2</sub> = (V × t<sub>2</sub>)/2 = (340 × 8)/2 = 1360 m</p>
<p>Distance between 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> echo</p>
<p class="equation">Velocity of approach = x = x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub> = 2040 - 1360 = 680 m</p>
<p class="equation">Distance between echoes X = 680 m</p>
<p class="equation">Time interval between echoes T = 126 s</p>
<p class="equation">Velocity = X/T = 680/126 ≈ 5.4 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>

<b>Example 10</b>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A plane sound wave of frequency 85.5 Hz and velocity 342 m·s<sup>-1</sup> is reflected from a vertical wall. At what distance from the wall does the wave have antinode?</p>
<p>A. 2 m</p>
<p>B. 4 m</p>
<p>C. 1 m</p>
<p>D. 3 m</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Frequency f = 85.5 Hz</p>
<p>Velocity of sound V = 342 m·s<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>Wavelength λ = V/f = 342/85.5 = 4 m</p>
<p>An antinode is ¼ of a wavelength</p>
<p class="equation">Therefore distance of antinode to wall = 1/4 × λ = 1/4 × 4 = 1 m</p>

    <p>
        Magnetic field is a region surrounding a magnet within which a force is exerted on any other magnetic substance. When a charge moves with a velocity <strong>V</strong> in a magnetic field <strong>B</strong>, the magnetic force <strong>F</strong> is given by:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>F = qVB sin(θ)</strong>

        <li>θ = angle between V and B</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note:
        <ol>
            <li>If V and B are in the same direction or parallel to each other, θ = 0° or 180°. Therefore, F = 0.</li>
            <li>If V and B are perpendicular or at right angles to each other, θ = 90°. Therefore, F is maximum.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        The force F on a conductor of length L carrying a current I in a magnetic field B is given by:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>F = BIL sin(θ)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>F is zero when B and I are parallel to each other. F is maximum when B and I are perpendicular.</p>

    <h2>Peak and Root Mean Square (r.m.s) Values</h2>
    <p>The peak value of an a.c. is the maximum value of the current recorded in an a.c. cycle.</p>
    <p>The r.m.s. current is defined as the steady or direct current (d.c.) which produces the same heating effect per second in a given resistor.</p>
    <p class="equation">I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = I<sub>o</sub> / √2 = 0.71I<sub>o</sub></p>
    <p class="equation">I<sub>o</sub> = √2 * I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = 1.414I<sub>r.m.s</sub></p>
    <p class="equation">V<sub>r.m.s</sub> = V<sub>o</sub> / √2 = 0.71V<sub>o</sub></p>
    <p class="equation">V<sub>o</sub> = √2 * V<sub>r.m.s</sub> = 1.414V<sub>r.m.s</sub></p>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>The current, I in an a.c. circuit is given by the equation: I = 30sin(100πt) where t is the time in seconds. Deduce the following from this equation:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Frequency of the current</li>
        <li>Peak value of the current</li>
        <li>r.m.s value of the current</li>
    </ol>

    <b>Solution</b>
    <p>The equation I = 30sin(100πt) can be compared with I = I<sub>o</sub> * sin(2πft).</p>
    <ol>
        <li>100πt = 2πft => 100 = 2f => f = 100/2 = 50Hz</li>
        <li>Peak current I<sub>o</sub> = 30A</li>
        <li>r.m.s current, I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = I<sub>o</sub> / √2 = 30 / √2</li>
        <p>Multiply the denominator and numerator by √2:</p>
        <p class="equation">I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = (30√2) / (√2 * √2) = (30√2) / 2 = 15√2 ≈ 21.21A</p>

    <p>From the given equation I = 2sin(ωt), peak current I<sub>o</sub> = 2A</p>
    <p>The direct current (d.c.) equivalent of an a.c. is the root mean square current:</p>
    <p class="equation">I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = I<sub>o</sub> / √2 = 2 / √2</p>
    <p>Multiply denominator and numerator by √2:</p>
    <p class="equation">I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = 2 / √2 * √2 / √2 = (2√2) / √4 = (2√2) / 2 = √2A</p>

    <h3>Example 4</h3>
    <p>If an a.c. is represented by I = I<sub>o</sub>. Calculate the instantaneous value of such a current, if in a circuit it has r.m.s value of 15A when its phase angle is 30°.</p>

    <b>Solution</b>
    <p>Given: I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = 15A</p>
    <p>From I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = I<sub>o</sub> / √2 and phase angle ωt = 30°</p>
    <p>Peak current I<sub>o</sub> = √2 * I<sub>r.m.s</sub> = √2 * 15 ≈ 21.21A</p>
    <p>Instantaneous current, I = I<sub>o</sub> * sin(ωt) = 21.21 * sin(30°) = 21.21 * 0.5 = 10.61A</p>

    <h3>Example 5</h3>
    <p>In an a.c. circuit, the peak value of the potential difference is 180V. What is the instantaneous potential difference when it has reached 1/8th of a cycle?</p>

    <b>Solution</b>
    <p>Peak voltage V<sub>o</sub> = 180V</p>
    <p>A cycle is 360°; 1/8th of a cycle = 1/8 * 360 = 45°</p>
    <p>Phase angle ωt = 45°</p>
    <p>V = V<sub>o</sub> * sin(ωt)</p>
    <p>From trigonometry, sin(45°) = √2 / 2</p>
    <p class="equation">V = 180 * (√2 / 2) = 90√2 V</p>

    <p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that if Δ<em>x</em> is the uncertainty in measuring <em>x</em>, and Δ<em>P</em> is the uncertainty in measuring <em>P</em>, then their product is equal to or greater than <em>h</em>, the Planck's constant.</p>
    
    <p>That is, therefore,</p>
    
    <p class="equation">Δ<em>x</em> ⋅ Δ<em>P</em> ≥ <em>h</em></p>
    <p class="equation">Δ<em>x</em> ≥ <span class="numerator"><em>h</em></span>/<span class="denominator">Δ<em>P</em></span></p>
    <p class="equation">Δ<em>P</em> ≥ <span class="numerator"><em>h</em></span>/<span class="denominator">Δ<em>x</em></span></p>
    
    <p>The uncertainty principle can be applied to the measurement of the energy <em>E</em> of an object at a particular time <em>t</em>. If the uncertainty in <em>E</em> is Δ<em>E</em> and the uncertainty in <em>t</em> is Δ<em>t</em>, the principle is represented as follows:</p>
    
    <p class="equation">Δ<em>E</em> ⋅ Δ<em>t</em> ≥ <em>h</em></p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p class="equation">Δ<em>E</em> ⋅ Δ<em>t</em> ≥ <span class="numerator"><em>h</em></span>/<span class="denominator">2π</span></p>
    
    <p>In all the above equations, Δ<em>x</em>, Δ<em>P</em>, Δ<em>E</em>, and Δ<em>t</em> are the uncertainties in the position, momentum, energy, and time respectively. Remember that momentum, <em>P</em> = mass (<em>m</em>) x velocity (<em>v</em>).</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <h3>Example 7</h3>
    <p>If the uncertainty in the measurement of the position of a particle is 5 × 10<sup>-10</sup> m, the uncertainty in the momentum of the particle is:</p>
    <ol>

    <p>Frequency <em>f</em> = 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> Hz</p>

    <p>Energy loss = -10.4 eV - (-1.60 eV)</p>
    <p>Energy loss = -10.4 eV + 1.60 eV</p>
    <p>Energy loss = -8.8 eV</p>
    <p>Since energy loss is always positive, the energy loss is 8.8 eV.</p>

    <h2>Equation of the Tangent to a Line</h2>
    <p>The equation of the tangent to the curve y = f(x) at the point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) is given by:</p>
    <p class="equation">
        y - y<sub>1</sub> = m(x - x<sub>1</sub>)
    </p>

    <h3>Example 4</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Find the equation of the tangent to the curve y = x<sup>2</sup> at the point (1, 1).</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>The slope of the tangent is given by the derivative of y = x<sup>2</sup>, which is 2x. At the point (1, 1), the slope is:</p>
    <p><em>m</em> = 2 * 1 = 2</p>
    <p>Using the formula for the tangent:</p>
    <p class="equation">
        y - 1 = 2(x - 1)
    </p>
    <p>Simplifying:</p>
    <p>y = 2x - 1</p>

    <h2>Equation of the Normal to a Line</h2>
    <p>The equation of the normal to the curve y = f(x) at the point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) is given by:</p>

            </span>
        </span> 
        (x - x<sub>1</sub>)
    </p>

    <h3>Example 5</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Find the equation of the normal to the curve y = x<sup>2</sup> at the point (1, 1).</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <p>The slope of the tangent at (1, 1) is 2 (from the previous example). The slope of the normal is the negative reciprocal:</p>
    <p><em>m</em> = 
        <span class="fraction">

                    <h2>Word Formation Processes in English</h2>
    
    <h2>Affixation</h2>
    <p>Affixation involves adding prefixes or suffixes to root words to form new words. Prefixes are added at the beginning, while suffixes are added at the end of words.</p>
    
    <h3>Prefixation</h3>
    <p>Prefixation adds prefixes like 'mis-', 'dis-', 'pro-', 'im-', 'pseudo-', etc., which change the meaning or word class of the base word.</p>
    <caption>Examples of Prefixes</caption>
    <table border="1">

    <h2>Compounding</h2>
    <p>Compounding combines two or more words to form compound words like 'blackboard', 'father-in-law', 'sugar cane'.</p>
    
    <h2>Blending</h2>
    <p>Blending combines syllables from two words to form a single new word, like 'smog' (smoke + fog) or 'brunch' (breakfast + lunch).</p>
    
    <h2>Clipping</h2>
    <p>Clipping shortens longer words while retaining their structural integrity, like 'exam' from 'examination' or 'mag' from 'magazine'.</p>
    
    <h2>Abbronymy</h2>
    <p>Abbronymy involves creating abbreviations or acronyms from group of letters, words, or phrases, like 'LAUTECH' (Ladoke Akintola University of Technology) or 'EEC' (European Economic Community).</p>
    
    <h2>Neologism/Coinage</h2>
    <p>Neologism refers to the creation or usage of new words or meanings, often through blending, abbronymy, or analogical creativity.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>English vocabulary expands dynamically through various word formation processes, reflecting changes in society, technology, and language needs.</p>
