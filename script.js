          ],
          explanation: "The period (T) of a wave is the reciprocal of its frequency. First, calculate the frequency using the formula v = λ * f, where v is the speed of sound, λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. Solving for f gives f = v / λ. Given v = 330 m/s and λ = 1.65 m, f = 330 / 1.65 = 200 Hz. Now, T = 1 / f = 1 / 200 = 0.005 seconds."

          explanation: "To find the current drawn from the input side (primary side) of the transformer, use the relation Vp / Ip = Vs / Is, where Vp and Ip are the voltage and current on the primary side, and Vs and Is are on the secondary side. Given Vs = 120V, Np = 200 turns, Ns = 50 turns, and Rs = 100Ω. First, find the secondary current Is = Vs / Rs = 120 / 100 = 1.2A. Then, Ip = Is * (Ns / Np) = 1.2 * (50 / 200) = 1.2 * 0.25 = 0.3A.
